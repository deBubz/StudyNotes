# PRNG & Block Cipher

## PRNG

A source of random numbers is essential in cryptography. It needs for **Session Keys**, **Shuffling of Cards**, **Challenges**, **Nonce**

- **Computers are deterministic** pure randomness is hard
- **PRNG functions** generate what appears to be statiscally random
- **Cryptographically secure PRNG** (CSPRNG) type of PRNG whos properties make it suitable for cryptography

### Sourcing randomness

PRNG produce the same sequence of seemingly random output when provided with particular **seed** data. Computers are deterministic, it must extract randomness (**entropy**) from an external/ truely random source. This can be:

- Thermal noice of hd
- Low-order bit fluctuation of voltage readings
- User input 
- Geiger counter click timing

### PRNG properties

- Desirable props of PRNG:
  - Repeatability
  - Statistical randomness
  - Long period/ Cycle
  - Insensitive to seeds
- PRNG can be broken by
  - Statistical test that finds the pattern/ biases in the output sequence
  - Inferring the state of the internal registers from the output sequence
- PRNG are a **critical part of a cryptosystem** as they can often be a single **point of failure**

### PRNG: Linear Congruential Generators

LGC generate sequence `x1, x2, ...` starting with `seed x0` with the rule

> `xn+1 = (axn +b) mod c`<br/>
> `a,b` are fixed constants

- This **period**(range) of the PRNG is at most `c`
- Only `xi, xi+1` are needed to determine `b`
- Commonly foundin libraries (unix `rand()`
- Easily predictable, must not be used for security

### PRNG: Linear Feedback Shift Registers

- LFSR comines the bits of a series of register and shift the output onto the register
- **seed** initial value of the regis
- easy and fast for hardware (1bit/clock)
- **problem** the config can be dertermined from the `2^n` output bits, `n` is the length of **LFSR period**

### PRNG: RC4 Stream Cipher

- **RC4** is a stream cipher which has a wide application in cryptography
  - RC4 was used to encrypt < 50% of SSL traffic
  - Core algo of Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP)
- Based on permutation of a 256 byte array, the **seed** is the internal array value
  - RC4's Key scheduling algo has know problem (WEP weakness)

### General Notes on using PRNG

- Be extremely careful with PRNGs Seeds
- hash PRNG inputs with timestamp or counter
- Reseed PRNG occasionally
- Use a hash function to protect prng outputs if PRNG is suspect

## XOR and OTP

### XOR gate

**XOR** "exclusive or" operation. One or the Other, not both

`a (+) b = (a + b) %2`

|a | b | a(+)b |
|---|---|---|
|0|0|0|
|0|1|1|
|1|0|1|
|1|1|0|

- bits a typically XOR together
  - often the plaintext will be XOR'd with a key to produce cipher text
  - Same as **Vigenere** cipher
  - XOR is addition, mod 2
  - **Vigenere** is add mod 26 since XOR works with bits, not letters
- XOR is commonly used to provide security in programs
  - Its weak but its a building blocks of most crypto primitives
  - Message `m` is XOR'ed bit wise with a secretkey
    - `c = m(+) k`
    - `m = c(+) k`
- XOR is effectively vigenere and easy to **break**
  - determine key length `N` from index of coincidence
  - shift ciphertxt by `N` and XOR with itself
  - this removes the key (`c(x)c = m(x)k(x)m'(x)k = m(x)m'`
  - Results in message XOR'ed with a shifted version of it self
  - Easy to then decrypt

### One Time Pad (OTP)

Real strength comes from the face thats a truly random key added to plaintext, produces a truly random ciphertext. **No amount of computing power can break a OneTimePad**. Bruteforce would yield each and every possible mesage that length

**Core Problem** key distribution, key destruction, synchro

- `k` must be same as `m` to encrypt `1gb` need a `1gb` shared key
- used for ultra secure, low bandwidth communications(military sat, Moscow-Washington phone line)
- **Future** Quantum Key Distro: secure distro at a distance

### Perfect Secrecy

GOAL: **Ciphertext reveals nothing about the plaintext**

a cipher has perfect secrecy if for all `m in M`, `c in C` the plaintext and ciphertext are statiscally independent:

> Pr[m1 = m2 | c1 = c2] = Pr[m1 = m2]

Assume each transmitted message is equally likely, the probability that the transmitted message `m` is 

> Pr[m1 = m2] = |M| ^-1

Now that the probalility that the transmitted `m` is given that the observed ciphertxt is `c` is

> Pr[m1 = m2] = ( **|{k:El(m) = c,k in L}|** ) / |k|

Key space `K` must be at least as large as the set of plaintext:

> |k| >= |M|

For `M = C = {0, 1}^n` any cipher with perfect secrecy satisfies `|K| > 2^n`

The OTP has perfect secrecy as `M = C = {0, 1}^n` thus

> Pr[m1 = m2] = 1/2^n
>
> Pr[m1 = m2 | c1 = c2] = 1/2^n

**note** we require `k in K` to be as long as the message, which means we need to securely communicate a key as long as the message in advance.
