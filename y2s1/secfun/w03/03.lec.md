- **Cryptanalysis** study of breaking them
- **Cryptology**(crypto) study of both cryptography and cryptanalysis

Crypto buiding blocks (cryptographic primitives)

- block ciphers
- stream ciphers
- digital signatures

## Functions

- Function of `f : X -> Y` is defined by
  - domain, a set `X = {a,b,c}`
  - codomain, a set `Y = {x,y,z}`
  - rule `f` assigning each element of `X` to an element of `Y`
- Example let a function `f : {-1, 0, 1} -> {0, 1, 2}` defined by `f(x) = x^2`
  - f(-1) = 1
  - f(0) = 0
  - f(1) = 1

### Properties of Functions

- When `f : X -> y` is a function
- `f : {-1, 0, 1} -> {0, 1, 2}` where `f(x) = x^2`
  - The image of `x in X` (domain) is called `f(x)`, an element of `y` (codomain)
    - image of `f(-1)=1`, here `-1 is in X` and `1 is in Y`
  - The range of `f` is set of all images, and is a subset of `y`
    - the range of `f` is `{0,1}`
  - If `f(x) = y`, then `x` is called a pre image of `y` (inverse)
    - the preimaeg of `1` is `f^-1({1}) = {-1,1}`
    - preimage of `2` is `f^-1 ({2}) = {}`

### OneWay Functions

- Write `{0, 1}^1 -> {0, 1}^m` is one way if:
  - its *easy* to compute `f(x)` for all `x in X`
  - it is "computationally infeasible" to find a preimage
- **Intuitively**
  - given `x`, its easy to compute `f(x)`
  - given `f(x)` its hard to compute `x`
- **Example**
  1. Write a message on the side of the plate `x`
  2. Smash the plate `f(x)`
  3. Finding the inverse `f^-1(x)` is hard but not possible (putting the plate back)
- **Data Encryption Standard Cipher** (DES)
  - `f(x) = DES(m, k) = c`
  - given `c` and `m`, it is difficult to find `k`

## Harsh Funtions

- **Keyed Hash Functions**
- Some Hashed func take both a key(k) and a message(m)
  - **MAC(m) = h(m,k)**
- Two type used
  - Message Authentication codes(**MAC**)
  - Hash-based message authentication codes(**HMAC**)
