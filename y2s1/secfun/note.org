** Intro to Security
*** Types of cyrptography
**** Classical Crypto
     - Symetric: Same key to encrypt/decrypt
     - Product Cipher: transposition, substituion cipher
**** Public Key Crypto
     - Asymmetric: two different keys, public to encrypt, private to decrypt
       Must be difficult to derrive private from public or chosen plaintext attacck
**** Crypto Checksum
     - Hash Functions and Keyed Hash functions(MAC and HMAC)
** Number Theory 
   - divisors, gcd, euclidean algo
   - modular arimethics
   - generators, inverse a is a^phi(n) mod p
   - CAIN closurem, assi, identity, inverse
   - Group -> rign -> field
** Hash Func & Ciphers
*** Context
    - Cryptography: study of math techniques related to cipher design
    - Cryptanalyis: study of breaking crypto
    - Crypto: study of both
*** HashFunc
   - Map a long string to a short fixed length string
**** General
     - used to store password, verify integrity, zero knowledge proof
     - Hash are preimage resistance, 2nd preimage resistance(hard to find a different m with the same c), collision resistance(same c different m) 
     - Collisions Hash Func satisfy collision res and 2nd pre
**** OneWay
     - Hard to find preimage of (x of f(x))
     - is pre and 2nd preimg resistance
**** HMAC/MAC
     - MessagedAuthedCodes - oneway hash func with key
     - HashedBased MAC
     - Mainly for integrity
**** Attacks 
     - Bruteforce(match) all posibilities to find match
     - usually takes 2^n-1 (n bit output)
*** Substitution Ciphers
    - Simplest: shift letter by 3, breable
    - Homophonic: prevent frequency analysis
    - Vinegrene: plain + key mod 26
** PRNG & Block Cipher
*** PRNG
**** Linear Confruential Generator
     - Sequence of num starting with seed and follow a rule 
     - insecure, easily reversible
**** Linear Feedback shift Generator
     - combines bits of a seris of register, shift output tonto register
     - insecurem can be fetermined from 2^n output 
*** OneTimePad
    - is using different substitution cipher for each letter of plain
    - perfecly secure if
     - k is truely randon
     -plaintext/key stream does not repear
*** Perfect Secrecy
    - Cipher doesnot reaveal anything about plain, very slow, high bandwidth
    - TwoTimePad is perfecly insecure
    - Streamcipher is malleable
*** Block Cipher mode of operation
    - ElectronicCodeBook: encr Each block seperately, open to freq analysis
    - CipherBlockChaining: blocks chained together using XOR, also uses randomIV, errors only affect 2 plaintxt box
**** Block Cipher
     - encr one block at a time, hard to reverse
     - ECB, CBC
**** Stream Cipher
     - One Byte at a time, easily reversed, complex, malleable
     - RC4, CFP, OFB
