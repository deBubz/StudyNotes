## Etherum

- Fully extends the concept of transactions, by creating "smart contracts"
- A contract is like an independent entity that is goverened by its code. It has data storage, its own currency balance and can be intereacted with via transactions
- Now we can easily run arbitrary software on a blockchain without creating a whole new chain
- Eth has an integral currency, `ether` which is burned as `gas` when executing contracts

## Smart contracts

**Smart contract** is a program on the blockchain. Like a normal program, they have

- Code
- I/O
- Data storage

Unlike a regular program, smart contract is executed by all nodes in the network.

Anyone can send Input to a smart contract, causing all nodes in the network to agree on the state change caused as a result of the message and code.

> **Smart contracts**
>
> - Is fully defined by its initial code(public code)
> - Cannot be modified (unless its code permits to)
> - can recieve input from anyone on the network
>
> Since a smart contract could fully encapsule business logic, they can be used to create decentralized autonomous organisations (DAOs)
