# Intro to CyberSec

## Start Simple

- Digital is different duh
- Bits (everything is bits)
- Bits have no uniqueness
- Easy to copy
- Most of information security is making it hard to copy bits
  - Its all a resource game (Time Money Computational Power)

### Implications

- Someone will get in given enough Time, Resource
- No perfect system, It will eventually fail
- When there's a will, theres a way

## How do Systems fail

- Often because designers
  - Protect the wrong things
  - Does it the wrong way
  - Made poor assumptions
  - Do not understand the threat model
  - Fail to account for Paradigm Shift( technology change)
  - Fail to understand the **system**'s scope
  - Generally **easier to break than secure**
- **Systems**
  - Product/ component, Infastructures, Applications**Systems**
  - IT staff, users, management, Customers and external users
  - Partners, vendors
  - Law, media, competitors, pollies, regulators

## CIA Triad (Aspects of security)

- **Confidentiality** only authorized people, resources, processes have access
- **Integrity**: protect data from international or accidental changes
- **Availability**: Data or syst is available by authorized users when needed
- **Authenticity**: proof of a message's origin integrity plus freshness (msg not a relay)
- **Non-Repudiation** msg enciphered with private key came from someone who knew it
- **Covertness** message existence secrecy (anonymity)

## Key figgures in security

- **Cryptography** Creation/development/application/testing encryption methods
  - Classical Cryptography: DES(Data Encryption Standard), AES(Advanced encrytpion Standard)
  - Public key Cryptography: Fiffle-Hellman, RSA
  - Cryptographic Checksum: HMAC
- **Encryption** converting original message to an unreadable form for unauthorized parties
- **Crptanalysis** breaking encrypted message to obtain original message
- **Cryptology** cryptanalysis + Cryptography

### Classical Cryptogtaphy

- Sender & reciever share common key
  - Or simple enough to be derrived from one another
  - Encryption and decryptopn used the same key
- Two basic types
  - Transposition Cipher
  - Substitution cipher
  - Product cipher (product on both)
- Also called **symetric** cryptography, where plaintext and ciphertext have the same size

### Public Key

- Sender and reciever use two keys
  - Private key only for each individual(for decryption)
  - Public key available for anyone (for encryption)
- Good Confidentialiy
- Integrity/Authentication
- **Asymetric** cryptography
- Should be impossivle to derrived private key from public
- **Public Key Crpto Requirements**
  - Must be **computationally easy to encr and decr** given the appropriate key
  - Must be **computationally hard to derrived** private key from public key
  - Must be **computationally hard to determine** the private key from a chosen plaintext attack

### Cryptographic Checksum

- Math function to generate sets of `k bits` from sets of `n bits` where `k <= n`(exept in unusual circunstances)

### Hash Functions

- Hash Functions `h` is an efficienty computable mapping of a long string `m` to short fixed length string
- **Properties**
  - **Compression** any number of bits to `< 512 bits`
  - **Ease of Computation** given `h` and `m`, the `h(m)` is easy to compute
- **Keyed Hash Functions**
  - some hash functions take both a key `k` and message `m`
  - `MACk(m) = h(m.k)`

- MAC - message Auth code
- Extra verification - HMAC

### Digital Signatures

- Encrypted meesaged that can be proven to be authentic
- to verify transfered information
- Uses Asymetric encryotion processes to create **digital signatures**

### Dicital Certificates

- Docs containing key val and id information about entity that control keys
- Digital signature attatched to certificate's contaner file
  - to certify the file is from the entity it claimed to be from

## Attacks on IS

- **Passive**
  - Dont modify/ fabricate data
  - Unauthorized party gained access to an asset
  - Release of messages(attack on **confidientiality**)
  - Traffic analysis (attack on **covertness**)
- **Active**
  - Fabrication(attack on **authenticity**)
  - Interuption(attack on **availability**)
  - Modification(attack on **integrity**)

### More on Attacks

- **Basis**
  - **Mathematical** based on analysis of underlying mathematics
  - **Statistical** make assumptions based on data/ examination
- **Methods**
  - **Brute Force**
    - going through all possible options to find the key
    - can be more effective given more resourses (hardware, time)
  - **Exploitaion**
    - Take advantage on the weakness of the ecryption algo, and any vector of information transmission
    - Encryption standards with known weakness are dropped fairly quickly

## Mandatory Security

- **Bell and La Padula Security policy**
- **Security properties**
  - SimpleSecurityProperty: subj has **READ** access to an object of te subject's security level dominates of the object
  - StarProperty: subj has **WRITE** access to an object if the subject's security level is cominated by that of the object

### Physical Security

- **Data Center**
  - Must be designed to include physical safeguards
  - Physical acces trumps all other forms of security:
  - No one solution is perfect: each facility are unique
- **Process and Plan** Effectiveness is ensured by
  - Threats are identified
  - Associated vulberabilities have been accurately characterized, prioritized and addressed
  - Implementation is based on a plan
  - Supervised and enforeced by consistent and ongoing management

### Application Security

- Normal Org has alot of in-house and externally developed applications
- Business process are continually moving towards web services
- However, data and critical business services are being exposed by
  - Lack of Testing
  - Insecure Applications
  - Human error
- Golden Rule: Security must be desined into the application and verified each step of the SDLC

### Network Security

- Network Protocols are generally vulnerable to
  - Port scan/ direct attack
  - Malicious Websites
  - Social Engineering
  - Phishing/ Pharming
  - DoS
  - Insider attacks
  - Information Leakage
  - Worms/Viruses
  - And much more
- Switches are vunerable (MAC address flooding)
- Issues on Local network (ARP poisoning, Rogue DHCP servers, Physicall access)
- Network Hubs are
  - Inseccure, All data is replicated to allports
  - no traffic isolation/controll
  - Any Station on the hub can examine **all** traffic
  - Collision problems on busy networks

### Access Control (**Confidentiality**)

- ensures only authorized access and denies all else
- **Methods**
  - Mandatory Access Control
  - Discretionary Access Control
  - Role Base Access Control

### Security Architecture

- Framework unifies reusable services and process to implement policy standards and risk management decisions
- Strategic framework that allows the dev and operations staff to align efforts
- parameters
  - Policies, Standard
  - Guidelines, Baselines
  - Procedures

### Operational Security

- Process and controls placed around your operations
- Assures confidentiality/ Intefrity
- Can help assure availability
- Provide migration for incidents
- Include HR process

## When things go wrong

- Business Continuity Planning/Disaster Recovery planning
- Importatnt and rapidly growing part of Information Assurance
- Security program is **deficient** if there isnt business continuity and disaster recovery planning
-**Investigations** involves
  - Log analysis
  - Network analysis
  - Digital forensics
  - Evience handling
  - eDiscovery
- **Risk Mangement**
  - Manage risks, threats, vulnerabilities
  - Mitigation Forms: Accepting, Mitigateing and transfer
