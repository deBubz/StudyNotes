# Intro to CyberSec

## Start Simple

- Digital is different duh
- Bits (everything is bits)
- Bits have no uniqueness
- Easy to copy
- Most of information security is making it hard to copy bits
  - Its all a resource game (Time Money Computational Power)

### Implications

- Someone will get in given enough Time, Resource
- No perfect system, It will eventually fail
- When there's a will, theres a way

## How do Systems fail

- Often because designers
  - Protect the wrong things
  - Does it the wrong way
  - Made poor assumptions
  - Do not understand the threat model
  - Fail to account for Paradigm Shift
  - Fail to understand the **system**'s scope
- **Systems**
  - Product/ component
  - Infastructures
  - Applications**Systems**
  - IT staff
  - users and management
  - Customers and external users
  - Partners, cendors
  - Law, media, competitors, pollies, regulators

## CIA Triad (Aspects of security)

- **Confidentiality** only authorized people, resources, processes have access
- **Integrity**: protect data from international or accidental changes
- **Availability**: Data or syst is available by authorized users when needed
- **Authenticity**: proof of a message's origin integrity plus freshness (msg not a relay)
- **Non-Repudiation** msg enciphered with private key came from someone who knew it
- **Covertness** message existence secrecy (anonymity)

## Key figgures in security

- **Cryptography** Creation/development/application/testing encryption methods
  - Classical Cryptography: DES(Data Encryption Standard), AES(Advanced encrytpion Standard)
  - Public key Cryptography: Fiffle-Hellman, RSA
  - Cryptographic Checksum: HMAC
- **Encryption** converting original message to an unreadable form for unauthorized parties
- **Crptanalysis** breaking encrypted message to obtain original message
- **Cryptology** cryptanalysis + Cryptography

### Classical Cryptogtaphy

### Symetric Cryptography



### Asymetric Crytography

- 2 keys are created
  - public for encr
  - private for decr

### Public Key Cryptography requirements

- Should be impossivle to derrived private key from public

### Cryptographic Checksum



### Hash Functions

- MAC - message Auth code
- Extra verification - HMAC

### Digital Signatures

- Uses Asynm Encryption

### Dicital Certificates

## Attacks on IS

- Passive
- Active

### Basis for attacs

- In Web term: to verify data from one site is comming from it
- SSL 

### Attack Methods

- Brute force
- Exploitation

## Mandatory Security

### Physical Security: Data Center

### Physical Security: Process and Plan

### Application Security

### Network Security

### Network Hub

### Access Control

### Security Architecture

### Operational Security

### Audits

## When things go wrong

### Investigation

### Risk Management

### Legal, Regulations, Compliance and investigations
