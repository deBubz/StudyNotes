## Recap

- **Design principles**
  - **visibility**
    - Interaction cues, information, opportinity
    - GOOD visibility provides cues that
      - lead the interaction, guide through series of task
      - indicate what is possible
      - communicate context of the situation
    - Color, Contrast, Size, Placement, Consistency, not cluttered UI
  - **feedback**
  - **constraints**
    - comparision btween interfaces/ interaction elements
      - appearance, visual metaphores, icons, elements used, steps of interaction, standard convention
  - **consistency**
  - **affordances** to give a clue
    - attribute of obj that allows people know how to use it
    - useful for both physical (real affordance) and virtual (percieved affordances)
  - **Mapping**
  - **Signifiers**
    - sinage for hints, labels, short intruction
    - used to reduce error

## Usability Principles and Heurostics

### Usability Principles

- Similar to design principles, more prescriptive
- Mainly used as the basis for evaluating systems
- Provide a framework for heuristic evaluation
- **A usability principle is a heurisitc**

Principles from Software Eng

|Principle| Description|
|:---|---|
|Know the user population|Being Sympatheic to different use needs|
|Reduce the cognitive load|Design so that users don't have to remember large amt of details|
|Engineer for errors|People make mistakes. Design system that can both prevent errors and enable recovery from errors|
|Maintain consistency and clarity|Consistant with standard operations and representations and from using appropriate metaphores. A designer's understanding of what is 'clear' depends on their understanding of their users|
|User familarity|Interface should use terms and concepts which are drawn from experience of the anticipated users|
|Consistency|Comparable operations in the UI should be activated the same way|
|Minimal suprise|useres should never be suprised by the behaviour of a system|
|Recoverability|Interface should include mechanisms to allow users to recover from their errors|
|User Guidance|Interface should incorporate some form of context sensitive user guidance and assistance|

Principles from Human-Computer Interaction for Software Designers
|Principle| Description|
|:--|---|
|Naturalness|user does not have to change their approach to their work in order to interact with the system|
|Consistency|Expectations built from using part of the system and are not frustrated by changes in another|
|Non-redundancy|user needs to input only the minimum info for systems operations|
|Supportiveness|Dialogue assisst user to use the system|
|Flexibility|Diiferent levels of user familiarity should be supported|

## Know the User Population

- Means being sympathetic to different user needs
- **Interaction Sytle** refers to all the ways user can communicate or otherwise interact with the computer system
- **user familiarity** interface should use terms/concpets which a drawn from the experience of the anticipated class of user
- **Reduce Cognitive load** Design so that users dont have to remember alot of details
- **Engineer for erros** Design to both prevent and enable recovery from errors
- **Recoverability** inteface should include mechanisms to allow users to recover from their errors
- **Consistency and clarity** from standard operations and representations
- **Minimal suprise** Never be suprised by the behaviour of a system.
- **user Guidance** incorporate context to provide guidance and assistance
- **Naturalness** User does not have to alter their approach to their work in order to interact with the system
- **Flexibility** Different levels of user familiarity should be supported
- **Non-redundancy** user needs to input only the minimum info for systems operations

## Usability Heuristics

For user design

1. Visibility of system status
   - Easily inform users of system operations with easy to understand/highly visible status displayed on the screen witin a reasonable amount of time
2. Match between the system and the real world
   - Designers should endeavor to minor the language and concepts users would find in the real world based on the target users
3. User control and freedom
   - Offer users a digital space where backward steps arepossible(include undoing, redoing actions)
4. Consistency and standards
   - ensure both graphic elements and terminology are maintained across similar platforms
5. help us recognise, diagnose and recover from errors
    - Should assume users are unable to understand technical terminolog, > error message should be clear, express in plain language to ensure nothing is lost in translation
6. Error prevention
   - Careful design to prevent errors
   - eliminate error-prone conditions or check for them and prevent users witha  confirmatin option before committing to the action.
7. Recognition rather than recall
   - minimize cognitive load by maintaining task-relevant info within the display while users explore the interface
   - Human attention is limited, only capable of maintaining ~5 items in the shorterm memory
8. Flexibility and efficiency of use
   - Abbreviations, function keys, hidden commands and macros
   - Allow users to customize or tailor the interface to suit their needs
9. Aesthetic and minimalist dsign
    - Display must be reduced to only the necessary components for current tasks
    - Whilst providing clearly visible and unambiguous means of navigation to other contents
10. Help and doccumentation
    - Any help information should be easy to search, focused on the user's task, list of concrete steps and not too large
