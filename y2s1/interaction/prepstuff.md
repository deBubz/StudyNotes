## Design Principles

- **Visibiity**: Show Opportunity to interact (visual cues), guide through task, show what is possible(color, contrast, size, placement, consistancy..)
- **Feedback**: response to interaction (usually immediate), show its working (include sounds, highlighting, animation ,visual effect, tactile, progress bar)
- **Constraints** restrict interactions to prevent error/bad options
- **Consistency** Consistant appearace, functions, standard covention within(internal) the program and with other systems(external)
- **Affordances** refers o the attributes of an object that show people how to use it(door knob). Includes both physical(real) and virtual (percieved) affordance
- **Mapping** Placements of objects
  - Gestalt - Simplicity, closure, symmetry/order, figure/ground, uniform connectedness, common regions, proxumity, parallelism, similarity, Focal points
- **Signifiers**: text signals(hints, labels, short intro) show how to interact. (push pull)

## Usability Design principles

### (Preece et al, 1994)

- **Know the User**: target audience duh
- **Reduce Cognitive load**: less clutter - so user dont have to remember large ammount of details
- **Enginner for error**: designed to prevent error and enable recovery from error
- **Maintain consistency and clarity** duh

### (Sommervile, 1995)

- **User familiarity** use terms/concepts which are already familiar to the targeted audience
- **Consistency** duh
- **Minimal Suprise** shouldnt be suprise by system behaviour
- **Recoverability** ui should include ways to recover from error
- **User Guidance** ui should include some form of context sensitive user guidance and assistance

### (Maculay, 1995)

- **Naturalness**: users doent have to change their approach to their work to interact of the system
- **Consistency**: duh - fancy expl: built expectation from one part of the system are not changed in another
- **Non-Redundancy**: user only need to input the minimum info(only neccesary) for system operations
- **Supportiveness**: "dialogue" assists the user to use the system (signifiers?)
- **Flexibility**: Different levels of user familiarity should be supported

## Usability Heuristics (nielsen)

1. Visibility of system status
   - Easily inform users of system operations with easy to understand/highly visible status displayed within a reasonable amount of time
2. Match between the system and the real world
   - minor the language and concepts users would find in the real world
3. User control and freedom
   - Allow users the ability to undo, redo actions (backword steps)
4. Consistency and standards
   - both graphic elements and terminology are consistent(both int/ext)
5. help us recognise, diagnose and recover from errors
    - assume users cant understand technical terminology
    > Clear error message, express in plain language to ensure nothing is lost in translation
6. Error prevention
   - design to prevent errors
   - eliminate error-prone conditions or check for them and prevent users with confirmations options before committing.
7. Recognition rather than recall
   - minimize cognitive load by maintaining task-relevant info within the display while users explore the interface
8. Flexibility and efficiency of use
   - Abbreviations, function keys, hidden commands and macros
   - Allow users to customize or tailor the interface to suit their needs
9. Aesthetic and minimalist dsign
    - Display must be reduced to only the necessary components for current tasks
    - Whilst providing clearly visible and unambiguous means of navigation to other contents
10. Help and doccumentation
    - Any help information should be easy to search, focused on the user's task, list of concrete steps and not too large

## Stuff

- Immersion
  - **Immersion** is the process whereby you become ‘immersed’ or deeply interested in a story or particular material.
  - **Immersion** implies a passive act, rather than something you are actively engaged in.
- **Engagement** is the process where you are actively ‘engaged’ in solving a particular problem.
- **Engagement** implies action – like trying to overcome a challenge, understand some difficult material.

> I got really immersed watching ‘My Neighbor Totoro’.  The story captures the wonder of being a child and really drew me in.
> Whereas, Tiny Wings is just totally engaging. The mechanics are elegantly simple and yet deeply challenging at the same time.

### Stuffs

- **Cognition**: input
- **Visual/auditory/tactile** perception: output
- Metahor
