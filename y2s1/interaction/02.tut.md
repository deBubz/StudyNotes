# Week 2

## Consistency

- Similar consistent design

### External

- Comparing different applications (phone numpad v calculator, the numbers are flipped around)
  
### Internal



## Constraint

- Disable/ grayed out what cannot be selected to reduce opportunities for error
- Dont confuse this with design that supports security/privacy (pin & password)

## Visibility

- Color and whatnot, depends on the purpose of the intention

## Signifiers

- label instructions, popups
- to reduce error in using something
- Use to show users how to interact with the design accurately
- Push pull sign on doors
