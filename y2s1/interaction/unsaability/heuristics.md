# Usability Heuristics

often this is a checklist(or a rule of thumb) to help evaluate UI of the system. ITs generally help to focus on

- How easy it is for people to use
- How useful it is
- quality of the overall user experiece

## How to approach

For each issue/ positive findings that ou noted **during** the testing:

1. Glance through all the heuristisc and decide which one is violated or compiled with
2. Either:
   - Clearly explain how each issue **violates** with the heuristics you chose
   - Clearly explain how each **positive** finding complies with the principle
