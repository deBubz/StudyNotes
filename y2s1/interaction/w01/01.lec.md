## Interaction Design

> Design of interactions btween people and product(software, apps, webapps)
>
> Goal is to create products that enable the user to achieve their objectives in the best way possible

- Relies on
  - understandong of capabilities and desires of people
  - kinds of tech avaliable to interaction designers
  - Knowledge to identify requirements and evolve this into a suitable design

### Dimensions of interaction desoign

- Words
- Visual Representation
- Physical Obj or spaces
- Time
- Behaviour

## Design principles and concept

> Design principle, concept and usability principles are carefully used to support **discoverability** and **understanding**

### Discoverability

- Is it easy fo find out what actions are possible? Where and how to perform them

### Understanding

- What is everything mean? How to use it?
- What are the controlls means

## Principles

- Generaliseable abstractions for thinking about different aspects of design
- Do and dont of design
- what to provide or hide in the interface
- Derived from a mix of theory-based knowledge, experience and common sense

### visibility

- Visual cues, show oppertunity to interact, provide information
- use to provide predictability of what will happen
- **Good visibility** will
  - Lead users through an interaction, series of task
  - Indidcate whats possible, communicatio context
- Uses Color, size, placement

### Feedback

- Communicate what action was done, whats accomplished
- Feedback must be immediate and informative
  - where is the feedback
  - current status, whats happening now, later and outcome
- Includes sound, highlighting, animation, visual effect, tactile feedback, progress bar, msg prompt

### Constraints

- Restrict possible interactions, prevent erroes/ incorrect options
- 4 types of constraints
  - physical: restrict physical movements
  - cultural: abstract constraints, rely of learned conventions
  - logical: rely on commonsense reasoning of the world
  - sematic constraints: rely on the meaning of parts of a system to dictate possible relationships

### Consistency

- Consistant appearance, visual elemetns, functions, standard conventions
- Componants with similar behaviours should have similar appearance( vice versa)
  - Benefits: Easy to learn/use, focus on task
- Internal
  - Designing operations within the application
- External
  - designing operations across different aplpications/devices

### Affordances

- Refer to attributes of an obj that shows people how to use it(door knob)
- Useful for both Physical(real affordances) and virtual (percieved affordance) objects

### Mapping

- Relationship btween the elements of two sets of things
- Concept in desgin and layout of controll/displays (GUI)
- Consist of:
  1. Placement and proximity (Gestatlt) grouping of related controls
  2. Connections and corolations to the realworld/ conventions
  3. Allow user to figgureout relationships/functions without memorising
  4. Allow users to intuitively figgure out its capabilities

#### Gestalt

Theories of visual perception

1. Simplicity
2. Closure
3. Symettry and order
4. Figure/ Ground
5. Uniform Connectedness
6. Common regions
7. Proximity
8. Parallelism
9. Similarity
10. Focal points

### Signifiers

- Affordance: What acctions are possible
- Signifiers(signals) Where should it take place
- Signifiers are more important than affordances
