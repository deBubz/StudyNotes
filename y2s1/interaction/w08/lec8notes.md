# Storyboard

Represent snapshots of the ui. But the interface is only a part of the story that occurs as people interact: what missing is context

The narrative Story board provides this context.
It use a sequence of images to tell a more complete story about peopl's interaction overtime, where each image represents a particular event.

## Cinematic Tecnique vocab

| Shot type | Description |
|---|---|
| Establishing Shot| The view is so far from the subject they are not even visible. Helps to establish the scene.|
| Long Shot | The subject takes up the full frame, or at least as much as comfortably possible.|
| Medium Shot | Shows some part of the subject in more detail while still giving an impression of the whole subject.|
| Close-up | A certain feature or part of the subject takes up the whole frame. |
| Extreme Close-up | Gets right in and shows extreme detail.Two shotA shot of two people, framed similarly to a mid shot. |

## Narrative Storyboard

Combines the vocab of camera shots and camera angles in a sequence. Helps to visually descrive the goal of our users scenario as a story over time.

## Usability in context of a product

- Intuitive Design and/or UI
- Ease of learning
- Efficiency of use
- Momorability
- Error prevention
- User satisfaction

Must **Evaluate the design** through user testing. UserCenteredDesign is an itterative process

### Usability Evaluation Stages

Are conducted during:

- Development process
- Post production

Why?

- Dev Process
  - Predict usability of an aspect
  - check team's understanding of the requirements
  - Test out ideas quickly and informally
- Post production
  - Public Beta
  - Identify user difficulties
  - Fine tune aspects, improva and upgrade

usability are and canbe  assessed against different sets of criteria

## Evaluation Criteria

Its important to grasp the **relationship** btween different frameworks/design models. e.g

> **Normans** when combined with **Nielsen** usability Heuristics can help us make usable products

1. Visibility of system status
2. Match between the system and the real world
3. User control and freedom
4. Consistency and standards
5. Help users recognise, diagnose and recover from errors
6. Error prevention
7. Recognition rather than recall
8. Flexibility and efficiency of use
9. Aesthetic and minimalist design
10. Help and documentation

[link](www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics)

Presence of one design principle doesnt mean that something is usable.

> **Error** popup presents but the **feedback** doesnt provide a path to recovery or clarity as to what has gone wrong and why.

So **combining** the feedback with one of **Nielsen**'s heuristics `Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors`

## Usability Testing & Eval Methods

There are number of methods to do a usability test.

- In isolation
- combination with other tests

Similarly, ther are different ways wo document the test and synthesise the data.

### Observation

Common method involves:

  1. Poviding user a task
  2. observe attempt at task

Can be recorded in written, filmed or both.
Notes might be structured into sections that relate to the interaction sequence of the process

**NOTE** direct observation may change the user's behaviour of their actions

Make sure to include metadata in the observation to inform about the context (environment, performance pressure).
Observation can tell us what the user `did` but not neccessarily `why` its done in that way

### Think Aloud method

Asking the user verbalie their though while completing the task.
Particularly useful in conjuction with **observation** to understand their thought.

**NOTE** user may just say what you want to hear.

### Debrief Interview Method

Similar to interviews at the start. Ask questions at the end about what was observed.

Allows user to reflect on their experience and give a more considered reflection.

Be mindgul that some details may fade from users memory and their recollection may be altered. User will also may be embarrassed by encountering usability issues, and report a 'false' reflection

### Other methods

1. Behaviour Tracking (Google Analytics)
2. Eye tracking
3. Cognitive load/ Bio Tracking

## Evaluation Doc

Important to have a structured way of recording and documenting your oservation an insight
