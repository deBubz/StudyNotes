## What is an architecture

- Common definition
  - SWA of a program or computing system is the structure(s) of the system, which comprise software elemets, the externally visible props of those elements and their relationship
  - fundamental orgazination of a system embodied in its components, their relationship to each other and to the enviroment, and the principles guiding its design and evolution.
  - solid description for completed systems hard to use to build one
  - **Architecture** is presented to enable/support the activities within it `cool`
- Challanges for architecture is not how it will function. Its how it responses to stress, exeptions and changes
- Not a passive element of the system but the **STRUCTURE** that enables the system to function.

### Structural elemets of a system

- Architecture is an abstraction(and different levels) of the system
  - Libraries, packages, moduels
- Difference btween architecture and design is **SCALE**
  - Architecture conterns structure
  - Design does not always concern structure
- Architecture of 
  - Building: wall stairs doors columns, pumbling, electronics
  - Computing system: Systems/subsystems, interface btwen systems, communication protocol

### Summary Architecture

- Basic definition
- Not everything has an architecture
- Architecture is concerned with structural elements of a system, their externally observable props and their relationships btween them, but its purpose is to support the system participation in the work around it.

## Why is Architecture Important

### It allow us to explore the problem

- Big Problem, Many current systems are developed to support poorly understood problems
  - Its vital to correctly develop a sound architecture as its more costly to implement the actual system
  - Modelling is good, allows us to understand the system's capabilities

### Modelling

- Allow communication with stakeholders.

### Its a transferavble abstraction of a system

- Can be implemented in other similar areas
- Last a long time.
- Replacing is very costly

### But its limited by the context

- It must Satisgy its Objectices
- Its limited by its constrain:
  - Knowledge of the problems and possible solutions
  - legacy systems and decisions
  - time/ budget
  - modelling langyage
  - avaliable technology for the solution.

### It limits what can and cant be done

- hard to alter architectural constrains once they are in place
  - Max size of a record
  - max number of records that can be processed
  - man num of users can be supported
  - ease of maintenance and modification
  - security
- e.g
  - loosy v tightly coupled components
  - specific connections btween components instead of flexible interfaces like message bus or facade

### architecture determine characteristis of the system

- functionality can be changed
- performance, responsiveness, security mostly determined by architecture
- high performance systems are difficult to maintain
- easily maintained/ modified hard to speed up
- secure systems are hard to access(vise versa)

### Summary architecture

- long lasting
- boundary objects btween customer and developers
- one more

## Why is Architecture hard

- no right answer
- comes at different levels of abstraction.
- qualities must be traded off with eachother (speed, maintainability, secure, accessibility)
- hard to figgure/remember all of its interactions
- architecures concern systems, will have emergent propertis
  - unexpected interactions
  - not a simple product

**NOT DONE .46**

## What makes a good architech

- can conceptualize solutions at disctinct levels of abstractions
- by organizing solutions into discrete levels, architechs are able to focus on a single aspect of the solutions while ignoreing all remaining complexities

### Coding rush

- Devs know solutions should be decomposed into levels of abstraction. However this is very difficult to apply in practice on actual projects. **VERY HARD**
- upon encountering the first hurdle, its easy to abbandon the abstraction and be a hack/ rush to code.
- Discipline.

### Layers of abstraction.
