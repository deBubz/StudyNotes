**Agenda**

- Iot Security case study review
  - why is it important
  - case study
  - discuss types of security issues
- How IoT is different form IT
  - discuss and present
- Discuss IOT threat vectors and Standards
  - common IoT threat vectors
  - common differentiators and multipliers
  - IoT standards (and lack) in AU, US, and EMA

## Brief

addressing security is very hard

- It requires a large set of skills to handle
  - the application layer
  - the network layer
  - the physical/hardware layer
- general economic trend is cost of device downwards
- limited guidelines and standards
- need variety of skill sets come up with new ways to address security

> generally sec is considered the biggest challange in IoT

## Types of Sec

- Data Sec
  - is the sensor (phys/data) secure and accurate
- Communications Sec
  - is the communication between sensors <-> central db/ application
  - secure and reliable
- Process/Application Sec
  - is the app logic secure
  - can it handle various events

## Case studies

- Stuxnet 2010
- German Steel Mill 2014
- Ukranian Power Grid 2015, 2016
- Dyn DNS DDoS attack 2016
- FDA recall 2017

## DISCUSS: IT v IoT

- discuss differences in security
