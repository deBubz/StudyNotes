# standards and communication protocols

- Why understanding protocols matters
- Open standards in IoT
- Landscapes of IoT Protocols
- IoT Protocol taxomonies
- Seleceting Protocols
- Review of network protocols
- Synergy or Competition
- Conclusive remarks

## Why protocols

- IoT cover a big range of industries and apps that scales from a single device upto very large cross-form deployment of 
  - embedded tech, cloud systems
- IoT colelct, sends and recieve data to application, obj and servers
- There are many protocols/standards in connection and they need to consider
  - bandwidth, range, power consumtion, node of the protocols
  
certain protocols are used in consideration of:
- availability
- scalability
- efficiency
- security
- mobility
- reliaility
- life cycle
- cost
- management
- interoperability
- privacy

## IEEE open IoT standards

some protocols in different layers

- **application layer** - HTTP, CoAP, EBHTTP, SSH ...
- **network/comms player** - IPv6/IPv4, RLP, TCP/UDP...
- **PHY/ MAC layer** - IEEE 802.11 series, 802.15 series, 802.3, 802.16...

> open protocol is defined by
> - IETF internet engineering task force
> - IEEE institute of electrical and electronics engineers
> - ITU international telecmmunication union

### Wireless IoT Network Protocols

- Wireless personal are network **WPAN** uses
  - bluetooth low energy **BLE** thread
  - zigbee
  - z-wave
  - EnOcean

- WLAN uses wifi which comes in many versions 
  - 802.11ah (key for IoT) or Wi-Fic HaLow
  - introduced in 2016

- wide area network segment WNAN

Use of IoT wireless protocol

- 40% business and manufacturing
- 30% healthcare protable
- 8% retail inventory tracking
- 7% security biometrics

> protocol comparison in data rate, power consumption & rating

## Protocol Taxonomy

IoT protocols can be grouped into 2 different categories
- Data
- Network (cellular/non-cellular network protocols)

Protocals can be further categorise according to **the layer of IoT ecosystem**

- *infrastructure* (6LowPan, IPv4/IPv6)
- *identification* (EPC, uCode, IPv6, URIs)
- *comms/ transport* (Wifi, Bluetooth, LPWAN)
- *discovery* (physical web , mDNS, DNS-sd)
- *data protocol* (MQTT, CoAP, AMQP, Websocket, Node)
- *device management* (TR-069, OMA-DM)
- *semantic* (JSON-LD, WebThing Model)
- *multi-layer frameworks* (Alljoyn, IoTivity, Weave, Homekit)

### Data protocol

- Message Queuing Telemetry Transport **mqtt**
- Constrained Application Protocol **coap**
- Data Distribution Service **dds**

## Selelcting IoT Comms Protocols

Some parameters to consider when selecting a communication protocol is

- Range
- Throughput
- Power Source
- Typical Topology
