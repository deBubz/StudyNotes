# differemce between accelerometer v gyroscope

> [source](https://www.livescience.com/40103-accelerometer-vs-gyroscope.html)

NOTE: this is not talking about sensors, but the actual device?
## Gyro

- uses gravity to determine **orientation**.
- its design is a free roltating disk(rotor) mounted to a spinning axis where its a large more stable wheel.
- when the axis turns, the rotor is **stationary** to determine which way is down

> - determine orientation
> - what angle is the limp is on
> - how high can the leg/arm lifts

## Acc

- to measure non-gravitational **acceleration**
- when the object changes from being still to any velocity
- also designed to repond to vibrations

## uses of gyro or accel

**main difference**: one senses `roltation`, the other doesn't

on acceleration
- accelerometw cannot distinct between acceleration with earth gravity
- gyroscope can measure the rate of roltation around axis

> gyro intend to dertermine an **angular position** based on the principle of rigidity and space

## on sensors

> accelerator used to determine acceleration

- a 3-axis accelerometr could id orientation relative to Earth surface
- one the object is movieng, its more complicate to interperate data
