# IoT In Context of Cloud

## Background

- ofc these days there are so much goddam data.
- It is inportant to understand the concept of **context**, data without context is useless
- So in IoT and Analytics:
  - data is captured, stored then analysed in a vacc, it may not have enough context to reveal anything useful

### Dimentions of IoT Data

- **Volume** - scale of data
- **Variety** - different forms of data
- **Velocity** - analysis of streaming data
- **Veracity** - uncertainty of data
- **Valadity**
- **Volatility**

## IoT Could and Data Analysis block

- **Edge Intelligence** - data analyzed close to the event before sent to the could
- **Cloud Platform** - store, analyze, act of the data from device/application using IoT cloud services
- **Service Delivery & Device management** - monitor & manage connectivity through the lifespan of your device.
- **Analytics** - large volume of data generated by IoT devices needs to ne denoise to enable predictive and prescriptive capabilities
- **ML** - auto learning its ecosystem, recognising internal/external operations and the right algo can optimise the efficiency of a component
- **Dashboards and Tools**

## IoT Events taxonomy

- Production (sensing/ control)
- Collection
- Brokerage
- Transformation
- Storage ( long term )
- Visialisation and Action

# Key IoT Attributes

## Velocity

- Telemetry ( rate of data report )
- application telemetry - measured every sec per server
- application and operational events (game engine estimates 1bil msg/sec)

## Volume

- variable rates, predictable and unpredictable burst
- on/off workload
- bursts, peaks is due to periodic increaded demand

## Variety

- refers to many data sources and types, structured and unstructured.
- traditionally sourced from spreadsheets and DBs
- IoT data come from sensords, emails, photos, videos, monitoring devices...
- This variety of unstructured data often creates storage, mining and data analysis issues

## More

- **Veracity**
  - uncertainty and quality of data (reliable, biased, accurate, noisy and abnormal)
  - data has to be meaningful relating to the analyzed problem
  - biggest challange in data mining
- **Validity** data correctness and accuracy for intended use. (veracity and validity are related)
- **Volatility** 
  - how long the data is valid and how long it should be stored.
  - data could become irrelevant to the analysis
- **Vulnerability** relates to cyber sec risk
- **Visualisation** represent ways to view data

## IoT Events, Activities and Actions

- **Production and Collection**
  - Telemetry
    - Localisation, Sensing/Actuation
    - Collection
