# Tutorial

Nothing much happens here beside installing a few software to prepare for future classes

- node-red `localhost:1880`
- influx DB `localhost:8086`
- grafena `localhost:3000`
  - check if its running with `sudo service grafana-server status`

> might as well just try to the other task from week 01 - 03

## Week 02 task

just running the programs?

- set `influxdb` as a datasource for `grafana`
- set `node-red` to display a demo flow 
- `node-red` may need some extra dependancies to display the correct nodes

> pretty simple following the doc

## Week 03 task
