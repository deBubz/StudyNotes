## What is Information System

A __Computer Based Information System(CBIS)__ or an __Information System__ is a:

- set of interrelated components that collect/recieve _data/information_ to be processed, analyzed, stored, organized and distribute information for a specific purpose.

### Fundamental Component of an Information System

- __Hardware__: Physical component of the information system. `e.g processor, printer, monitor...`
- __Software__: Programs controlling the function of the hardware. There can be OperationS Software (OS), Anti Virus(AV), Utility Software and Application Software(used for specific information processing needs)
- __Database__: Data collection
- __Network__: Allow computer communications. WAN and LAN
- __Procedure__: A set on instruction to combine hardware, software, database and network to process input and generate the desired output.
- __People__: The ones that use the system.

## Information Technology (IT)

Information Technology VS Information System

- It consist of the hardware and software used by an organization to achive an objective
- Also, refers to computer-based tools that suports information processing. `Includes hardware,software and communication technologies`.

## Information System (cont)

Firm use Information system to produce valuable information. This information is used to make decisions, controll operations, analyze problems and create new product/services. The process to achieve this includes:

- __Input__: capture raw data from within the organization or from its external environment
- __Process__: conversion of raw data to meaningful information
- __Output__: Transfering processed data to the one that needs it, mostly to support an activity.

Information System also requires feedback to better refine the processes and improve the overal system.

### __`Example` Hotel reservation system__

1. Input: data reservation, customer's name, address, room booked, date, payment info
1. Process: Calculate fees, store data, send payment request to banks.
1. Output: reciept, order confirmation.

## Major capabilities of Information System

- Perform high-speed, high-volume numerical computations.
- Provide fast communication and collaborations.
- Store huge amount of information.
- Allow quick and inexpensive access to vast amount of information.
- Automate __business process__ and manual tasks

__Business Processes__ are a collection of activities that create products/services of value to the organisation, its business partners and/or customers. Information Systems helps execute processess by providing necessary data to complete the task.
