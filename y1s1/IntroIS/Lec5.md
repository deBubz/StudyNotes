# Data and knowledge management

## Outline

1. Managing data
1. The database approach
1. Data warehouse and data marts
1. Big Date
1. Data management

## Objectives

- Regarding data management, Data Governance can be used to address common chalanges
- Advantages of relational databases
- Big Data, what are its basic characteristics
- Knowledge Management systems in organisations

----

## Data management

An effective Information System needs to have effective data management. This is to:

- ensure accurate information
- ensure Information is readily availible when it is required
- ensure the relevancy and usefulness of the information.

### Difficulties of managing data

- Exponentially increasing amount of data recorded
- Data comes from multiple different sources(needs to sort it)
- Data rot (Outdated, destroyed, forgery?, hardware wear and tear)
- inconsistent, conflicting due to non- intergrated information system.
- Mananging sound data is very vital to the business

----

## Data governance

A set of enforcable __standard policies__ on how to handle data in an organization, how to manage data entegrity. This consist of how data is gathered, stored, accessesd, backed up.

### Data Governance process

1. established data governance
   - Identify and define what policies are needed.
   - establish data governance council.
1. define standard data policies
1. Enforcement
1. Audit, Monitor , control
   - regular inspections to see if these policies are followed

### Problems with traditional File systems

- __Data Redundancy__ repetition, cause inconsistency and storage issues
- __Data Inconsistency__ data not updated.
- __Poor Security__ who can access it.
- __Poor Data Sharing Ability__ hard to share in a timely matter

----

## Database

Data Storing Technology that can easily centralise all stored data. Databases are often used along with data Governance.

### Advantages of databases

- Minimal Redundancy
- improved consistency
- improved security
- improved accesibility for sharing
- enforcement of standard
- improved data quality

Data bases are are managed using a Datamase Management System __(DBMS)__. Easily users __CRUD__ functions, which are __C__ reate, __R__ emove, __U__ pdate, __D__ elete.  

----

### Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)

- Diagrams which represents _entities_ and their _relationships_ in a database.

### Data warehouse and Data Mart

If an organisation find they dont have data, they can access:

- __Data Warehouse__: Collections of information, collected by operational databases(from other orgs) that supports business activities and decesion making.

- __Data Mart__ : A scaled down version of a data warehouse designed for end-users need in an individual department.

----

## Big Data

This is a bread term used for large and __complex structured and unstructured data__ that is near impossible to process using tradditional data processing methods. Big Data is often used by organizations to gain more value and performence for their processes.Some characteristics of Big Data are:

- __Volume__
- __Velocity__
- __Variety__

### Data mining

Data mining is the process of analyzing existing data to find patterns and insights not offered by raw data alone. This includes:

- Identifying fraudulent credit card transactions
- Identify characteristics of profitabble customers

----

## Knowledge Management

The procedure what companies uses to get more value from their knowledge assets. Knowledge can be both explicit or tacit.

### Knowledge Management Cycle

- __create__ : As people figgures out new and different ways to do things.
- __capture__ : knowledge identified and presented in a meaningful way.
- __refine__ : knowledge refined and put in actionable context. Tacit knowledge must be captured along with explicit facts.
- __storage__ : knowledge stored in reasonable and accesible formats.
- __manage__ : must be reviewed regularly to be accurate and current.
- __disseminate__ : be readily availible to anyone at in the org, and at any time

### Knowledge Management System __KMS__

- Refers to a collection of systems that is used for the genaration, storage, sharing and management of valuable tacit & explicit knowledge.

## case study : nzld flubys

- use big data(transactions shopping) from the flybys card to detect pattern and behaviour, hence, can suggest products and services to more suit the comsumer`s need.
- use the flyby card also to issue rewards, therefore improving loyalty.
