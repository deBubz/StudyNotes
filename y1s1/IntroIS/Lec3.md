## OUTLINE

- Transactional Processing Systems __TPS__

- Decision Support Systems __DSS__
- Executive Support Systems __ESS__
- Functional Area Support Systems __FAIS__
- Enterprise Resource Planning __ERP__
- Reports

## Transaction Process System __TPS__

- Serves Operational mangers perform __Daily operational Tasks__ and track the flow of transactions. Also used to monitor status of internal operations and firm's relations with the external environment
- Produces data for other Information Systems.

> __Transaction__: any bussiness event that generates valuable data.
>
> __Transactional Information__: All Info contained within a single business process/work.
>
> `e.g. payroll, CRUD, shop checkout.`

### TPS Processes Data in 2 ways

- __BatchProcessing__: Transaction data, putting it in groups or batches, and processes it periodically(Not instantly).
- __Online Transaction Processing(OLTP)__: Transacions are processed online as soon as they ocurr. (Instantly). Mostly used in e-shops

---

## Decision support systen __DSS__

- Let __middle Management__ examine large amounts of detailed datas from __different sources__, both __internal__(data from TPS) and __external__(see data-warehouse) sources could be used to make a decision. One of the key fuctions of __DSS__ is to analyze pattern and trends.
- Used to support performance of manegerial annalysis and or __semi-struntured/ unstructured__ decisions.

### Common Decision Support Systems Techniques

- __What-if-analyst__ - what if this happens
- __Sensitive analalysist__ - extension of what-if, handles volatile data/ info, assess impacts.
- __Optimization analyst__ - Optimize your processes
- __Goal Seeking Analyst__ - Research the means of achieving a specified goal. GIT THAT DONE


Decision Support Systems could be used used to solve recurring, specific problems. Such as calculating the cost of Oceanic transportation. Using the __Voyage Estimating Systems__ to processes all sort of data, such as Travel time, cost, projected earnings.

---

## Executive Support System __ESS__

- __High level__ system used by _senior/executive managers_ addressing longterm issues, or sumarizes firm performances.
- Data often presented on a __dashboard__.
- Used in non-routine high level decisions, needing top level support, evaluation, insight.

---

## Functional Area Information System __FAIS__

Each of these Functional Area Informational System or __FAIS__ supports a particular operation of the organisation(to increase efficientcy and effectiveness):

- __IS for Production/Operations Management__
  - Responsible for the Product/ Operation Management(POM) where Input is transforms into useful output. Some of these activiteis includes:
    - Inventory management (Overstocking - incr cost, Understocking - reduce earnings)
    - QA/QC
    - Product planning and operation
- __IS for Accounting and finance__
  - Payrol
  - Managing financial transactions:
    - Expense Management - Earnings, Cost
  - control and auditing (Budget management, track spendings)
- __IS for Human Resource management__
  - Staff management (Recruitment, Special requests)
  - Payroll and Employee's Recor
  - Benefits administration.

## IS for Marketing

Support marketing function, providing sales force automation to assist with salesmen with the sales process, a key component of an operational __Customer Relationship Management(CRM)__

---

## Enterprice Resource Planning System __ERP__ **

__Enterprice Resource Planning(ERP) System__ were designed to correct the lack of communicaion in Functional Area IS(FAIS), as FAIS were developed _independently of one another_

ERP achieve this by intergrating FAIS with a common __Database__ and streamline dataflow across different FAIS.

### Extended ERP Modules

- __Supply Chaim Management(SCM)__ Manage information flow between different stages in a supply chain to maximize efficientcy and effectiveness. This can alsobe used to plan, schedule, controll and optimize supply chain in aquiring raw materials and reception of finished products.
  - Can be used to manage relationship with suppliers by sharing information with suppliers regarding order, inventory levels, and delevery of products.
- __Customer Relationship Management(CRM)__ handle business process that deal with customers in sale, marketing and services and optimizing relationship with customers.

---

- __Quality and Efficiency__ better flexibility in customer support

## ERP Failure

- Changing existing business processes
- Can be complex, expensive and time-consuming to implement

### Causes

- Failure to _involve affected employees_ in the implementation process
- Rushing, trying too much, too fast
- Insufficient training
- Failure to perform data conversion and testing of the new system

---

## Reports

All Information System produces reports, which falls into 3 cattegories:

- __Routine reports__
  - Produces at scheduled intervals(weekly, monthly).
  - Though this is very useful to managers. More information is often needed thats not presented in this.
- __Ad-hoc(OnDemand) Reports__ can be request including these type of information:
  - __Drill down report__: more __detailed__ information
  - __Key Indication Report__: sumarizes performance of __important activities__.
  - __Comparative reports__: __Compare performance__ of different bussiness units, teams.
- __Exeption reports__: includes any information that falls __outside__ of the standard reports.
