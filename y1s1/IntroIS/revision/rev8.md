# Aquiring Information Systems and Applications

The planning process for new IS/IT application __begin__ with the analyis of the organisational strategic plan. This is to identify the firm's overal mission and goal (IS should suport the org to reach their goals)

> IT Steering Committee establishes IT priorities and ensure the IS function address the organisation's needs.

## Evaluation and justification

IT investment is very important and can be done by a __cost benefit analysis__ method. It is vital to assess it it is worthwhile to accquire a new system.

### Fundamentals decisions in IT applications Aquisition

- __How much code does the company want to write?__ A company can choose to use a pre-made application, customize a prewritten application, or custom-write an entire application
- __How will the company pay for the application?__ Companies can buy or lease the application.
- __Where will the application run?__ It could be run in the internal platform or someone else's. Company can employ a SaaS vendor or an application service provider
  - __SaaS__ method of delivering software. A vendor hostthe application and provide them as a service to customers over a network, Typically the Internet. Customers do not own the software; they paid for using it
- __Where will the application Originate?__ Premade software can be open-source or from a vendor.

## Systems Development Life Cycle(SDLC)

This is the traditional systems development method used for large scale IT projects. The SDLC is a __structured framework__ that consists of sequential processes by which information Systems are developed. The Stages of SDLC are:

1. __System Investigation__: perform _feasability_ study to make No/Go decisions
   - Technical Feasability, checks whether the existing technical resources can support the candidate system or not, depends on what it supports
   - Economic Feasability to determine the benefits and cost of adopting the system. Comparing Expected Earnings, Expences and the required time to complete the project
   - Behaviourial feasibility address the human issues of the system development project `e.g would it be easity accepted by emplyees`

2. __System Analysis__: Identifying Business Requirements the system must satisfy (Use knowledge to assess what users want from the system)
3. __System Design__: Define technical System specification `e.g hardware, sogtware and network`
4. __Progrannubg and Testing__: Checking if the code produces desired result and detect errors.
5. __Implementaion__: The process of converting from an old system to a new one
   - __Direct Conversion__ Old system cut off and new system is turned on at a specific time
   - __Pilot Conversion__ Introduces the new system in a small section of the org and test to see if it is functional. Then the whole organisation will apply the new changes gradually.
   - __Phased Conversion__ Introduces seperated components of the system. Each module is assessed and if it works properly, then the next one is introduced untill the whole system is operational
   - __Parallel conversion__ old and new operates simultaniously for a time. Rarely used
6. __Operation & Maintenance__
   - __Debugging__
   - __Updating__ to accomodate changes in business conditions

## Tools/ Approaches for system development

- __Prototyping__ an approach that defines an initial list of user requirements, build a model of the system and refine it in several itterations based on feedback
- __Intergrated Computer Assisted Software Engineering Tools(CASE)__: tools witch automate task in the SDLC:
  - __Upper Case Tools__ used in the early stages (System investivagions, analysis)
  - __Lower Case Tools__ to automate the later stages (Programming, Testing, Operations, and maintenance)
  - __Intergrated CASE(ICASE)__ provide links between upperCASE and lowerCASE tools

---

## Alternative methods/tools for development

- __Joint Application Design(JAD)__: Group-based approach for collecting user requirements and creating system design. Most often used in system analysis and design stages. System analysy/developer and users jointly define, review and agree on the requirements
- __Rapid Application Development(RAD)__: A method that combine JAD, prototyping and intergrated computer-assissted software engineering (ICASE) tools to rapidly produce highquality systems.
- __Agile__
  - Methodology that delivers functionalities in rapid itterations
  - Requirements and solutions evolve through collaboration between self-organizing, cross- functional teams.
  - Require Frequent communication and collaboration, development, testing and delivery.
