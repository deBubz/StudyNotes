# Information Security

## Threats

Threats to IS refers to undesireable events that can cause harm to IS. Some characteristics of threats to IS

### Threat source and Intent

- source
  - Internal threats: arise from individuals or events inside of a company
  - External threas: arise from individuals or events outside of a company
- Intent: 
  - Intentionsal: threats are result of harmful decisions
  - Unintentional: threatsa are introduced without awareness or malicious intent `e.g user/ operator error`

### Threat Agents

- Human Threats: caused by human actions such as insiders(employees) or hackers with cause risk or harm in the system
- Environmental factors: caused by non-human agents. It comes first from natural disaster threats like earthquakes, flood, fire, lightning, wind or water.
- Technological Threats: are caused by physical or chemical processess on material.

## Vulnerabilities

Refers to the weakness in an organisation's system or security policies that can be exploited to cause damage. _Factors_ contributes to vulnerabilities in IS:

- Communication Networks
- Domestic and offshore partnering
- Smaller, more portable devices
- Lack of management support

## Information System security threat:

- __Espionage or tresspass__ unauthorised attempts to gain illegal access to organizational information
- __Denial of Service Attack(DoS)__ Offender sends a large amount of request to a target computer system that the target cannot handle them successfully and crash.
- __Identity Theft__ the Stealing of another person's social security number, credit card number, and other personal detail for financial purpose and/or frame the target for a crime.
- __Social Engineering__ the perpetrator use social skills to trick or manipulate legitimate employees into providing confidential information
- __CyberTerrorism__ Attacks via the internet using a target's computer system to cause physical real- world harm and interrupting the floow of information
- __Malicious Software__:
  - `virus` destructive programs which perform malicious actions and disrupt normal functioning of Information system.
  - `Worm` segment of code that perfrom malicious actions that replacate and spread by its own
  - `Trojan` appear to be legitimate software but carry a destructive payload. Trojan release payload of nasty malware applications
  - `Alien Software` not as harmful as viris, worm or trojan, but does use up valuable system resources
  - `Spamware` use your system as a lauchpad for spam
  - `Adware` software that cause pop-up advertisement to appear on your system.

## Information System security

Precautopms taken to keep all aspect of Information System safe from:

- Unauthorized acess
- Destruction
- Manipulation

### IS Security Process

Assessing > Developing strategy > Implement control and training > Monitor

### IS Security is an ongoing process, consisting of:

- __Assessing Risks__: To obtain an __understanding__ of the risk to Information Systems. Organizations assess the values of their protected assessts to determine the probability of being compromised, and compare probable cost of compromisation with the estimated cost of protection.

### Mitigation strategies:
  - Transfer the risk by purchasing insurance
  - Implement controls that minimise/block the impact of the threat
- __Developing A security Strategy__ A formulated strategy that details what IS controlls should be implemented. IS strategies should focus on:
  - _Preventive contols_ To prevent potentially negative events from occuring `e.g preventing unauthorized acess to facility`
  - _Detective Controls_ to assess whether anything went wrong `e.g unauthorized acess attempts`
  - _Corrective control_ to mitigate impatcs of any problems after it occurs, `e.g data backups`. Ingeneral, policies and procedures guide user's decisions and establish responsibilities, this includes:
    - __confidential Information Policy__ outlines how sensitice information is handled(Storage, transmission, disposal)
    - __Security Policy__ explains technical contols on all organizaional computer systems such as acess limitations, audit-control software, firewalls, and so on
    - __use Policy__ outlines the organizations' policy regarding appropriate use if in-house computer systems; May mandate no internet surfing, use of company computer systems only for work purposes, limited use of external storage devices
    - __Backup Policy__ requirements for backing up critical data incase of data loss
    - __Account Management Policy__ list procedures for adding new users to systems and removing users who have left the organization
    - __Incident handling Procedures__ list procedures for handling security breach
    - __Disaster Recovery Plan__ list steps an organisation take to restore computer operations incase of natural/deliberate disasters.
  - _Implementing controls and training_
    - __Physical controll__ to prevent unauthorized individuals from gaining access to a company's physical facilities
    - __Acess Controll__ 
      - `Authentication` confirming the identity of a user]
      - `Authorization` determines with action/ rights or privilage the person has
    - __Firewall__ a network security system that monitors and contolling network traffic based on predetermined security rules
    - __Encryption__ process of encoding messages using an encryption key before they enter the network or airwaves, then decoding them using a matching key at the recieving end of the transmission so that the intended recipients can access it
    - __Anti-malware Systems(AV)__ software packes that can identify and eliminate virus worms and other malicious software
    - __BlackListing__, __WhiteListing__
    - __System Development Controls__ when systems are designed to by purchased (Saas), care must be taken that all security features are implimented, enabled and managed.
    - __Human Controls__ Various human safeguards can hel to protect information systems, specifically ehtics, laws, and effective management.
    - __Deployment and Training__ Personnell throughout the organization should recieve training about the security policies and plans for disaster recovery.
    - __Following ovjectives set in guidelines__ Review the entire IS infastructures, Following objecticves set forth in guidelines such as the Control Objective for information and related technology (COBIT)
    - __Computer forensics__ the use of formal investigative techiques to evaluate digital information for judicial review.
  - _Monitoring Security_
    - __Monitoring external events__ monitoring publishing security alerts
    - __Information System Auditing__: examination of IS including I/O, and processing to ensure they are functional. Types of audiors and audit:
      - `Internal` performed frequently by internal auditors
      - `External` reviews internal audit result and perform independent audits.
