# Data and Knowledge management

Effective Information System is needed to stay ahead of the competition

__An effective Information__ system provides users with accurate, timeley and relevant information

## What makes data management difficult

- The amount of data in increasing exponentially
- Data are scattered and collected by many individuals using different method and devices
- Data comes from many sources
- Data Rot (Outdated, Destroyed/ damanged storage media)
- Inconsistent, Conflicting data due to non-intergrated Information System.

### Managing data is very important

__Data Governance__ Is to ensure established data standards and policies are defined and enforced across the whole organizations.

1. established data governance
   - Identify and define what policies are needed.
   - establish data governance council.
1. define standard data policies
1. Enforcement
1. Audit, Monitor , control
   - regular inspections to see if these policies are followed

## Database

### __Databases__ are used to address above problems

- Its a collection of data organized by centralizing and controlling data.
- Its a collection of related __attributes__ about an __entity__
  - __attribute__: for a person `e.g name, age, gender`
  - __entity__: someting you collect data about. Each record contains many attributes.

__Database Management System(DBMS)__: software that permit organizations to centralize data, efficiently manage and provide acess to stored data by application program.

### Even without a database, companies can utilize these to impove their business process

__Data warehouse__: logical collection of information, gathered from many different operational database to suport business analysis activities and decesion making

__Data mart__: low-cost scaled-down version of datawarehouse designed for end-user needs in an individual department

## Advantages/ Disadvantages of databases

|Advantages| Description|
|---|---|
|__Minimal data Redundancy__|Single copy of data ensues storage requirements are mimimized|
|__Improved data Consistency__|Eliminating redundancy reduces posibility of redundancy|
|__Increased Security__| Easier to enforce access restrictions due to a centralized system|
|__Improved data Quality__|Centralized controll, Minimized redundancy, improved data consistency help to enhance data quality|
|__Improved data accessibility and sharing__|Centralization simplify deployment and access controll for personal within/outside of organizational boundaries|
|__Enforcement of standards__|Centralization simplifies the enforcement of standards and rules in data CRUD functions|
|__Program-data independance__|Much easier to alter software according to changing business needs. (decoupling design)|
|__Increased productivity of application development__|Datastandrds make it easier to build and modify applications|
|__Reduced program Maintenance__|Data changed in the central DB is replicated seamlessly throughout all applications|

## Data Heirachy

- __bit__ smallest process unit (0 and 1).
- __byte__ single character, letter number, symbol
- __field__ logical grouping of characters into word or small group of word
- __record__ logical grouping of related fields `e.g` student name
- __file__ logical grouping of related record

## Big data

Big data is a broad term used for both large/complex structured and unstructured data that is typically difficult or impossible to process using traditional data processing method. Its characteristics are:

- High Volume
- High Velocity: the rate of dataflow
- High variety: different formats

> Organizations use _BigData_ to gain value and improve performance.

__Datamining__ the process of analyzing data to find patterns and discover insight not offered by raw data.

## Knowledge Management(KM)

The process an org use to gain the greatest value form its knowledge assets:

- __Explicit__ knowledge that can be doccumented, archived and codified, often with the help of IS
- __Tacit__ knowledge that are located on a person's mind and are usually difficult to be doccumented.

### The Knowledge Management System(KMS) Cycle:

1. __Create Knowledge__
1. __Capture knowledge__
1. __Refine knowledge__
1. __Store knowledge__
1. __Manage knowledge__
1. __Disseminate knowledge__

KMS is typically a collection of tech based tools that inclde communication techs as well as information storage
