# Pacemaker Recall Exposes National Need for Research and Education in Embedded Security

## CCC Council Member and Cybersecurity Task Force Chair Kevin Fu, University of Michigan

Food and Drug Admission (FDA) Issued a first makor recall because of a cybersecurity risk.
near half a million pace makers are recalled for immediate software update where clinicians will apply duing the patient visit.
 recall highlights the need to build security into the Internet of Everything that is powered by embedded computing systems.

â€œWhile the Internet of Things brings exciting advances to various aspects of our lives ranging from healthcare to transportation, defense, finance, manufacturing, and critical infrastructure, they also create vulnerabilities in critical infrastructure at an unprecedented scale

 there is a large gap in the research and education needed to build security into embedded systems ranging from medical devices and autonomous vehicles to the Internet of Things.

 our country struggles to be on speed dial for world leadership in embedded security

 Because of early investments in embedded security by industry and government, Europe and Asia are home to the top embedded security university labs in the world such as Belgium,  Germany,  U.K., China. Embedded security faculty have departed the U.S. for these brighter research opportunities overseas. The U.S. government even outsourced the manufacture of electronic passports to a European-based embedded security company. 
 While an economic boon for some countries, this outsourcing trend will likely worsen as U.S. households and businesses embrace IoT technology, and seek products and security solutions from vendors overseas

 ## what can help the US catch up

 Nation wide effor in embedded security research and education.
