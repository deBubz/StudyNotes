# Executive summary

## Structure

1. __Intro__
   - IoT is a have high growth and is widely being adapted for day-to-day life, However there isnt much concern in designing new product with security in mind.
1. __Point 1__ : Usage of Iot Today
   - IoT is used to generate large ammount of data for personal and industrial use. 
   - There is a lot of sensitive data
   - Wide range of devices are encorporating IoT features. Cars, Locks, alarms, Public transport, logistics, cities, energy. (The vital stuff)
1. __Point 2__ The current Market, current view on IT 
   - Education are more focused on creating than protecting.
   - focused more on programming rather than security.
   - Companies are more focused on building the next technological innovation.
   - IoT devices are not built with strong security features.
1. __Point 3__ Vulnerabilities
   - Current devices have alot of vulnerabilities.
   - DolphinAttack: ultrasonic sound which cannot be heard by the human ear. It can triggers audio devices such as Siri/Google/AmazonAlexa to carry out commands.
   - masking physical sensors
   - The fitness tracker devices, fitbit, which is the most secure fitness tracker still have exploitable security vulnerabilies in its whole system architecture.
1. __Point 4__
   - the Damages can be devastating if systems are breached.

1. __Conclusion__
   - To ensure better growth and consumer's trust, there need to be better security considerations for IoT Devices.

The Internet of Things has gradually become more and more prevelent in today's _society?_ (Wierdas word).
It is involved in your home, monitoring temperature, lights and even door locks.

The Important question is, It is safe enough to ensure its continuous application and usage?
It is well Known that IoT is being intergrated in every aspect of mordern life. Whether it is for personal use, transport, healthcare and even for industrial work.
Handling and gathering large amount of information of its users

BUT it is Secure
