To James
I am writing to ask whether you would be willing to be interviewed by a group of UTS students aboutÂ being a project manager. This is for an assessment and we are asked to record it to create a vodcast. I can provide more information with a connection.
Thank you for your time.
Regards
Bao

First of all, on behalf of my group, I would like to thank you for agreeing to be interviewd by us.

I would like to restate that the interview would be about your experiences with in your career and the day-to-day task you perform. I have also attatched the list of questions that we will go through in the interview.

We were also asked to record the interview so that we can produce a vodcast as a part of our presentation.
Additonally attatched in this email, is a release form that we will provide for you on the day.

The interview would only take around 30 min of your time so when would it be convienient for you?
would around mid-day tomorrow(14th Sep) good for you? If not how about Tuesday next week (18 Sept).
Monday is not possible since one of our team members have a work commitment.

Lastly, I would like to thank you again for giving us the opportinity for this conversation and for that here's a picture of my cat.

Looking forward to hearing from you

Regards,
Bao Hoang
