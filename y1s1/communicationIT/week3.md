# EVALUATION 

So evaluating sources

### Whats importance:

__Relevance__ - topic wise and keep audience in mind

__Reliability__ - check the author(must be an accademic), from what publication, what type of text is it.

__Accuarcy__ - check the references, what type of reserch, evaluate the article yourself and explain if its good or not.

__Lack of bias__ - is it biased, consider who funded the research, does it also look at the opposite side of the arguement.

__Completeness??__ is it completed. is it complete, how __broad__ is the topic.

__Timeliness__ - how recent is the article, is it updated, when is is published. Becareful with this as tech changes fast.
