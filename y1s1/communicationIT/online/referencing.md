# Referencing

Theres a [youtube link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_ikJLypADg) for referencing but it seems to be broken.

[Library Havard Referencing guide](http://www.lib.uts.edu.au/help/referencing/harvard-uts-referencing-guide)

There is also an interactive guide in the above link.

UTS also have a software to help with referencing called Endnote. Always double check the result since it is not always accurate.
