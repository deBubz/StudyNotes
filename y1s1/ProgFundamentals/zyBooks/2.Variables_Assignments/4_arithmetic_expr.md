## Arithmetic Expressions (int)

  ---

## Floating Points

- decimal numbers initiated using `double`

---

## Scientific notation

- __Scientific notation__ are use to represent longer numbers that is larger and smaller than 0.

e.g. `1.0e-3  = 1.0 * 10^-3`

---

## Constant Variables

- variables which are not changed after initialising.
- also known as __final__ variable.
- good practice is to all caps variable name seperated by underscore (FINAL_PRICE)
- use the keyword final before datatype ``final double FINAL_PRICE = 3;``

---

## Math Methods

- __Square Root__ of x : ``Math.sqrt(x)``
- x to the __power of__ y : ``Math.pow(x, y)``
- __Absolute Value__ of x : ``Math.abs(x)``

- Math can also do sin cos tan.
