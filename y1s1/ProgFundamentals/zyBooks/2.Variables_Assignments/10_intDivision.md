## Int Division and Modulo(mod?)

- watch when dividing int as it will remove any fractions(dataloss)
- will round down to nearest number `2.9 = 2`
- ofc divide by 0 will return an error you _egghead_.

### Modulo Operator (ffs just say mod)

- Returns remainder of 2 int.
- `10 % 4 = 2` 10/4 = 2 remainder `2`
- returned value cant be larger than the divided by value

## Type Conversions

- AS the title says, its the conversion  of datatypes
- Casting `(double)intA/intB`
