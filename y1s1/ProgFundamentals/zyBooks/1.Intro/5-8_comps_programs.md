# Computers and Programs (General)

## Switches

Something about 1s and 0s or known as __bits (binary digits)__. These switches combine to make more complex circuits, used in the early 1900 to perform calculations.

## Processors and Memory

Simply put, __Processors__ process data. __Memory__ stores data that will be processed. _See 1.1_

## Instructions
|Basics Intructions||
|----|---|
| Add X, #num, Y | Add num to data at X, storing in  location Y|
| Sub X, #num, Y | Subtract num from data in X, storing in Y|
| Mul X, #num, Y | Multiply data in X by num, storing in Y|
| Div X, #num, Y | Divide data in X by num, storing in Y |
| Jmp Z | Tells the processor, the next instruction to execute is in Z |

__NOTE__: dis be assembly

## COMPUTER TOUR

A computer usually consist of:

- __Input/Output device__: a __Monitor__ displays the GUI. __Keyboard__ and __mouse__ for the user to input data. These are usually called peripherals.
- __Storage__ or __disk__: used to store data such as programs, videos, files... Disks are _non-volitile_, which means they keep that content even when its powerd off.
- __RAM (Random Acess Memory)__: temporary hold read data from storage. It is designed for data to be accessed significantly faster than Storage data. RAM is a volitile storage, meaning data will dissapear when its powered off.
- __Processor__: this runs the computer program. Performing operations, reaad, write instructions from and to the memory.

__Moore`s Law__: thinkgs get faster,smaller,better over time.
