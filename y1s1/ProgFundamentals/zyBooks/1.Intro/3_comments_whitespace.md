# Comments and Whitespace

## Comments

They are text that the programmer added to the
code, to be read by people and provide clarity and is __ignored__ by the compiler.

```java
// single line comment

/*
    Multi-line comment
    or
    A comment block
*/
```

__NOTE__: Java supports another type of comment. __JavaDoc__, a specially formated multi-line comment that can be converted to program documentation in HTML.

## WhiteSpace

This refers to blank space(Space or tabs) between items and statements. The compiler ingores most _whitespaces_.

Different organisations may have different conventions on how to use whitespace.
