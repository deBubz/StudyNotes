# Bank Object Oriented

This is to test your understanding of class structures

Look closely at the variables' accecibility and fix accordingly.

TODO: Constructors, Methods, some variables

## Fields

```java
private static double interestRate = 0.0;
private final int accountNumber;
private String accountName;
private double balance;
// keep an eye of accessibility
```

## Constructors

```java
// Look closely at structure and documentation
    public BankAccountOO(int num, String name)
    {
        this.accountName = name;
        this.accountNumber = num;
    }

```

## Methods

```java
// very simple, fix returntypes, arguements
    public static void setInterestRate(double newRate)
    {
        interestRate = newRate;
    }
```
