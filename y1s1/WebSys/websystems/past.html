            More about me.
            so my programming journey started around the end of 2016
            I was a bit lost in life, failing in studies.
            But then I found freecodecamp. They taught programming
            Starting with web design(haha), It was pretty cool at the time
            and I fell in love with it.

            So I went to Tafe, did a cert4 in Programming, then a Diploma in software
            Learned WebDesign, C#, Java, SQL
            Made a few useless apps
            Taught my self Git, the command line and how to get better.

            And now I'm here, still learning to be better.
