# Study sucess 2

> something something I feel good. Lets keep this up


ok remembering the steps of memory in the previous session.

it is signigicantly better to _understand_ the __concept__ rather than the exact _vocab_.

---

## Academic reading

Reading is bloody hard when you both read and think.

__ACTIVE READING__ is key

## ALSO PREPARE before reading

What do you expect form the Text. What do you want to gain from it. how does it help what you already know.

## Have an overview of the text

- whats it abt
- how does it fit with the topic/ prev readings
- who wrote it?
- purpose?
- Headings/ diagrams/ sumaries

## INTERACT with it
- Identify what you want answered
- know whats related

## READING ACTIVELY
- critically think and identify keypoints as you go
- identify suporting evidence
- CRITISIZE everything

### HIGHLIGHTING???

so this means make notes of what part of reading is vital to you that explain that key points clearly.

Its a tool that assist your thinking.

ok SLIDES ARE visual aid. they are not the CORE information. 100% attendance mate.

## PARAPHRASE that shit

Verbating word by word is great but 
FUCKING UNDERSTAND IT. Through paraphrasing . YOu`ll remember it better.

`check what uyou just read`

`sumarry`

## review that shit

SUMMARY/ CONSIDER YOUR QUESTIONS.

### `SUMARY`

    - if it doesnt seem to be helpful
    - if youre unsure
    - _Dont have too many read-in-full at a time_
