# PaaS

## Understanding Computing Platform

There are many formal definition of *Computing Platform*.
It is a *combination* of **hardware/software** resources used for application developments.

Its other uses are

- to **build** new software
- to **enhance** existing software
- to **execute** software

Stacks of the computing platform

- Software Development framework ( .NET, JDK )
- IDE to assist in development
- OS
- Hardware

## Platform as a Service

Platform as a Service ( PaaS ) are commonly used to refer Computing Platforms.
Which are **provided over the internet** to cloud consumers via **web interface**

> *"The capability provided to the consumer is to **create and deploy applications** using*
> *programming languages, libraries, and tools supported by the provider"* `NIST definition`

Implications to the **cloud consumer**:

- doesn't need to pay upfront expenses for the computing platform
- exposed to the *software framework* only via an interface
  - no need to worry about the underlying cloud structure
  - visibility over the provided framework only
- not responsible for ongoing maintenance/upgrade of the platform
- has control/ownership of the developed application

### PaaS Components

PaaS just as other cloud products contain these layers

- End users
- Interface
- Virtualization Layer
- Software Resource
- Hardware Resource

PaaS also provides access to all the required resources for building applications such ass
  
- IDEs
- Collaboration tools
- Unit testing, stress testing, integration testing, prep-production testing...

## PaaS Implications

- Your code and data resides Externally
  - PaaS Provider
  - PaaS provider may in turn be making use of an IaaS Provider
- Accessibility is governed by the provider
- Not all lang, dev features or runtime features are supported
- Problems with changing PaaS provider due to comp compability between compilers ( propriety )
  - Apex compiler from Force.com something about propriety Compilers

## PaaS Example - Google App Engine

- Provides a software platform for app development
- Users can develop apps using the provided software platform and deployed them on the Google Cloud
