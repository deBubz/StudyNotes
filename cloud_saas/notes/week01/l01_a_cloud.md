## Overview of cloud computing

### Evolution in Computing Software


- Gradually the philosophy for engineering computing software moves to **Process-Oriented** Architecture
  - Programs are broken down to processes, that acted upon shared data
  - Data structures are complex and large
- Next **Object Oriented** Architecture
  - Reflect real world objects and entities
  - Object is an **encapsulation** of a data structure, and the methods or operations to access those structures
- Then **Service Oriented** Architecture
  - where applications are organized as "software services" ( **components** )
  - A serviced can be invoked ( called ) to deliver its functionality
  - Promotes **reuse** of software in services across a range of applications
- **Cloud Computing** were created over a long time and is a combination of various past computing architecture (service + grid)

## Cloud Computing

### *Pooled* ( computing ) computing resources.

- resources from the cloud service provider are made available to the requestors ( available as requested without any constraints )

### Elastic *scaling* of resources

- Apps require base level of computing resource under normal circumstances. AND may need more resources at peak load.
- Hence, **elastic** scaling involves dynamically, to save time, resource and money depending on the demand
- move from investing in **Ca**pital **Ex**pense ( capex ) to **Op**erational **Ex**pences ( OpEx )
  - no-upfront cost
  - reduce value of OpEx due to economies of scale?

### *Virtualization* of resources

- The whole physical server can be partitioned ( split ) to many virtual servers.
- Virtualization is enabled through mechanisms such as hypervisors
- Ensuring each virtual server acts like a real server

### Pay-as-you-go / Metered

- Typically no-startup fees or setup fees, and you pay based on your consumption of resources
- Enable SME to use large scale IT resources
- Enable large enterprises to reduce cost
- and Fine-grained metering and billing of resource usage

### Resource delivery over the net

- Resource are delivered in the internet
- Computing resources are provisioned as a "service"
- services includes Hardware Infrastructure, Computing platforms, and software
- APIs are provided to access and use the provided resources


### Automation of new resource deployment and de-provisioning

- New/More resources requested through an API ( which are configured and are ready to use ) ( Provisioning and deployment )
- Provisioned resource will be de-provisioned when no longer needed
- No effort from the consumer to configure, provision, maintain and update the extra resources.
