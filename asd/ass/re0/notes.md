# deliverables

## begin

1. cover sheet, header page
	- containing group name, student id and signature
2. approved project scope
	- each student 2 features
	- each features, many **user stories**

## software requirements

consolidated requirement backlog ?

1. functional requirements
	- a consolidated functional requirements backlog
	- each person 2 features.
	- each will analyze the feature abd break down into user stories (linked to scope items)
	- capture in consolidated team project req backlog spreadsheet
2. data requirements (data dictionary)
	- each will analyze their feature and **document data requirement**
3. non-functional requirements
	- identify and captire atleast **5 non functional requirement** as user stories in the requirement backlog

## software project plan

consolidated project schedule, cost estimates & time sheet

1. project schedule for release 1 and 2
	- release starting dates are on the subj outline
	- each student will estimate and prioritise the user stories identified for the assigned feature in the context of thw whole project
	- select user stories relevent to assigned features in consultation with team and tutor for each of the releases
2. project cost estimates, based on the input from the individual students in the group
	- calc cost estimates for r1,r2 for assigned features
	- rolled up to calc project cost. assuming youre working on it 8-10 h per week
3. **project time sheet** for your time working on your feature

## solution architecture

1. data architecture model
	- made based on the data requirements
	- provide and describe the conceptial data model diagram (without attributes) for the assigned features in the context of a whole project.
	- concepts & relationship
2. application architecture model
	- describe the application architecture for their assigned feature in the context of the overal architecture
	- diagram should show the application componetn following the MVC or relevant pattern with appropriate design decision
	- use whiteboard, UML or modelling stuff

## solution design

1. interaction design model
2. backend database design model

## software prototype

software prototype

1. prototype interface (2)
2. prototype programming logic (2)
3. prototype database (1)

## devops pipeline setup

Each will configure the DevOps pipeline on their laptop and produce config details and/or script files if relevent

- code flow management setup (github) (2)|
- CI/CD and noSQl setup (2)
- monitoring/logging & testing setup

## quality/presentation

- present the working DevOps pipeline and prototype from your machine

## appendices

- content from the individual **contribution logbook**
- references to external sources
