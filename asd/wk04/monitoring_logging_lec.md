# Logging and Testing

## Monitoring & Logging

- **monitoring** provides info aobut application performance or functioning
- **logging** generates a set of events relevant to your application ruining in the cloud or non-cloud environment
- **monitoring** and **logging** your app's data is **important** to ensuring the smooth running of the app
- the application logs data can then be communicated to relevant people or team members for a swift response

## Automated Testing

For now we cover 2 types of testing:

### Acceptance Tests

- acceptance testing is done to ensure that the application meets the requirements (user stories & scenario)

> have a look at **cucumber**

### Unit Tests

- unit testing is applied to **software/functions** to determine that the tested components are performing as planned

> have a look at **jest** or **react testing library**
