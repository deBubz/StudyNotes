# Week 1: Intro to software development

## Professional Software Dev

This part compare developing software as an individual v a group

The main difference is where

- Individual: ALL CODING BAYBEE, you do what you think is good
- Professional: 
  - Again emphasizing how important requirements is
  - Team will have individuals focusing on all aspect of the business (UI/UX, usability, technical/non-technical, documentation).

### Software Characteristics

- Functionality or features
- Performance
- Maintainability
- Dependability
  - Reliable, secure
  - Does what it is built to do
- Usability
  - Accessability, User interaction I guess

## Model driven software development

> so what do first. Its **NOT CODING** for sure

this shit needs planning, a lot of planning.

This stage involves building the model of the product you are using.
Then build the software that matches the model, and of course as with Agile, the model could be improve every sprints.

Building a model also help satisfy, and clarify with stakeholders that the project is correct.
Helps them understand better on how the solution works or or if it needs to be changed

## Software development process

Typical Software Development Life Cycle:

- Big Bang Software Delivery:
  - Water fall 
    - Classic type, the majority of the time will be spent implementing and planning
    - In this model, it is very difficult to implement change
- Incremental Software Delivery/ Release
  - Incremental Model
  - V Model
  - Rational Unified Project

> This subject covers
> - PLanning & Analysis
> - Architecture & Design
> - Implementation & Testing

## Software development roles

Presents the people involving in the Software Development process. This usually involves 2 teams

- Business Team
  - normies
- IT Team
  - nerds

## Agile

- Development is carried out in Iterations
- Great for tackling change in plan
- Have small periodic releases. 

### Agile Elements

- [Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org)
- Agile value & Principles
  - Individual Interaction > processes and tools
  - Working software > comprehensive documentation
  - Customer collaboration > contracting negotiation
  - Responding to change > following a plan
- Agile Methods & Practices
- Agile Benefits
  - Early Delivery
  - Adaptability
- Agile Challenges
  - More difficult to implement for larger projects which needs more planning/ documentation
  - Face-2-face communication, in self-driven teams
