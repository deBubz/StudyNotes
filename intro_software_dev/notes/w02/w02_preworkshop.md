## Notes

### Agile User stories

- Creating **user story**( used to help support agile principles )
  - working software is the primary measure of progress
  - top prior is customer satisfaction though early/continuous delivery of valuable software
  - KISS - do the essentials first
- Visualize work to **TODO**, **DOING**, **DONE** columns(`Trello`) where each task are user stories
  - Simple Story Template
    - **AS a** _____ **I want to** ____ **So I can** ___
    - **As a** mobile app user **I want to** save data to the cloud **So I Can** access them else where
    - Basically asking who what why
  - Make sure stories create value to the customer/user
  - Make sure the stories doesn't depends on each other
- Write stories from user perspective
    > Software usually fails weren't focused on delivering **actual business value** to users
    >
    > `Ehhhh failed financially maybe, not necessarily technically`
- **Overall** Build the app the way user think about value

### Nordstrom Innovation Lab Case Study

- Building app on customer feedback, shows agile process
- ASk customers on how they decide on sunglasses, their thought process
- paper prototype after stories, and test it on actual users
- mvp testing, get customer feedback and fix bug
- all introduced features provide some sor of value to the users

### SCRUM - Estimating user story

- Product back log or **Customer wishlist** on everything that makes a product good
- This video cover how to use planning poker to estimate time/importance on user stories
- Use modified fibonacci to represent the numbers ( these are just rough estimations )
- The Scrum master adds
  - What needs to be learned before working on this story
  - Is it possible to refactor old existing code, or is it built from ground up
  - Unit test
  - Does this user story have external dependencies
  - Has anyone completed a similar task
- Discussion should not take more than a couple minutes per story
- Everyone has their own estimate cards, and everyone presents the card as the same time
- Then the outlier explains their choice and they re-pick their choice
- HOW TO GET STARTED
  - pick one of the smaller stories first

### Agile Cost Estimation

6 Simple steps to calculate your agile budget

1. Prepare and estimate the project requirement using Planning poker
2. Determine the team's **velocity**
3. Using the team's burn rate and velocity to calculate budget for the iteration
4. Add any capital cost
5. Using the definition of **done** and pre- and post- iteration budgets
6. Apply a drag or fudge or risk facto to the overall estimate

#### Estimate project requirement with PLanning poker

- IF SCRUM is used, you should have a **Product Backlog**.
- Extreme Programming and you will be creating **user stories**
- Planning poker is used to estimate work load/cost of each user stories ( not necessarily time )
- The "Score" are assigned to each individual tasks on the list

#### Teams Velocity

- means the team decide how long their sprints are ( 2 - 4 weeks )
- it all depends on your team.
- team will also decide how much work is accomplished per sprint

#### Using te team burn rate/ velocity to calculate budget for iteration

- use the team velocity ( how much the team can complete per sprint ) and the burn rate to estimate the budget
- The budget for part of the project is done in the cycles by the cyber team

#### Add any capital cost

- equipment cost, supplies, licenses
- The job of the Project manager is also to check with the team if there are any large mandatory purchases

#### Use the definition of "done", add pre- and post- iteration budget

- Every agile teams is supposed to be "cross functional" with other external teams
- there are usually **other** work ( by other specializations ) that needs to be completed before or after the project is completed
- this cost will also need to be added?
  
#### Apply drag/ fudge/ risk factor to the overall estimate

- Before coming up with the final estimate, add some amount based on risk or uncertainty ( never subtract )
- feel free to add any buffer.
