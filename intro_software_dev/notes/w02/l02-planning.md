- story points and value points using fibonacci sequence numbers ( 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21 )

## Prioritization

- H, M and L prioritization classes
- WSJF - Weighted shortest job first ( program an portfolio level prioritization )
- Minimum marketable features or MVP

- 2 axis process work flow and priority

## User Story Backlog

## Agile Plan

- When use stories are assigned to the team and completed through out each iterations to ensure release.
- Considerations
  - **Velocity Estimation**: the amount of stories that a team can deliver in 1 iteration ( team size, experience )
  - **Cost estimates**: cost estimate at a project, release and iteration level
  - **Benefit realization**: happens at project, release and iteration level
  - **Agile governance and funding**: funding per release ( minim discovery and design workshops )
  - **Risk and issues**: Risk and issue register

## Agile v Traditional Planning

| Agile | Traditional |
|---|---|
| Adaptive | Too much upfront detail |
| Short releases and iterations | Large traditional planning documents based on assumptions |
| Focus on release and iteration in hand | Illusion of a complete plan |
| Just in time details |

## Challenges in Agile planning

- Lack of commitment, collaboration from stakeholders
- Lack of active test team/ active architect team engagement.
- Lack of active feedback
- Loss of holistic vision
- Handling rework/defect/new stories in an iteration
- Comparing different team velocities as KPIs
- Difficult to change the fixed budget and cost mindset.
