# Software Testing

## Testing Overview

Testing entails many different parts

- unit testing
- acceptance testing
- exploratory testing
- user acceptance testing
- system integration testing
- regression testing

### Testing Automation levels

1. end-to-end testing
2. system testing
3. acceptance testing
4. integration testing
5. unit testing

## Acceptance Testing

> Given `context`
>
> when `action or event`
> 
> then `expected result or outcome`

derived from a user story to test the `expected result`

## Unit Testing
 
Test for expected behaviour of methods/class

Some Testing frameworks:

- JUnit
- NUnit
- JMockit
- PHPUnit
- EMMA

## Defect Management

- defect occur due to failed tests or some other reasons
- how to fix
  - capture and track defects
  - prioritize and fix
  - `defects` are considered as a *clarification* of requirements in agile projects, if it can be fixed within the current iteration

## Change Management

- project change request may be raised during the SDLC
  - requirement change
  - plan change
  - architecture change
  - implementation change
- how to handle change
  - capture project change request ( PCR )
  - track PCR
  - analyse PCR
  - assign and implement PCR
  - test and close
