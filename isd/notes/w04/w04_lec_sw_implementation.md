## Code Management

- `code version management` - keep track of different version of your code, components or configs and the systems in which these components are u sed
- also ensure changes made by individuals in the team do not interfere with each other

### Codelines and Baselines

- `codeline` sequence of versions of source code with later versions in the sequence derived from earlier versions
  - normally applied to components of systems so that there are different versions of each component
- `baseline` definition of a specific system
  - hence specifies the component versions that are included in the system plus a specification of the libraries used, config files, etc.

### Code version management system

- version and release identification
  - manage versions are assigned identifiers when they are submitted to the system
- storage management
  - to reduce storage space required storing multiple older versions
- change history and recording
- independent development
  - keep track of components that have been checked out for editing
- project support
