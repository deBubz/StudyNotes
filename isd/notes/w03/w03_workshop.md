## Solution Design

### **DEMO** User Journey map

- identify users
- identify the process stages ( awareness & interest, explore courses )
- identify user goals for each stage ( e.g look at user benefits )
- identify UI **components** and **flow** across the process stage
- identify relevent user stories linked to each process stage ( user story map ). you can use the use story id here rather than writing a full user story in the user journey map.
- (Optionally) discuss pain points and target user satisfaction level for each process stage.
