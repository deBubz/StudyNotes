## Agile v Traditional Analysis

| Agile | Traditional |
|---|---|
| Simple | Complex |
| High level | Too much upfront detail |

## Conclusion

- Tickets are concerns, request or issues which are raised by the software user or customer
- Epics == high level user story
- User stories need to be small enough to be completed in a single iteration or sprint
- Use cases are documented to capture the detailed narrative, scenarios, personas, wire frames
