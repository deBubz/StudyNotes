3.1

## Transport Service & Protocols

- Provice logical communication btween app process running on different hosts
- transport protocols runs in end systems
  - Sender: breaksup messages into **segments**, passes to network layer
  - Reciever: reassembles segments into messages, pass to app layer
- More than 1 transport protocols avaliable to apps
  - **internet**: TCP & UDP

## Transport Layer Service

- Reliable, in-order delivery(TCP), also has
  - congestion controll
  - flow controll
  - connection setup
- Unreliable, unordered delivery (UDP)
  - no-frills extension of "best effort" IP
- Service Not availiable:
  - Delay guarantees
  - bandwith guarantees

## 3.1 Miltiplexing & Demultiplexing

- **Multiplexing** at sender: handles data from multiple sockets, add transport header(later used for demultiplexing)
- **Demultiplexing** at reciever: use header info to deliver recieved segment to correct socket

### Addressing: Transport v Network layer

- **Network Layer**: logical communication between Hosts
- **Transport Layer**: logical communication btween Processes. Enhances/relies on network layer services.

### How Demultiplexing works

- Host recieves IP datagrams
  - each dtagram has source IP address, destination IP address
  - Each datagram carries one transport-layer segment
  - each segment has source, destination, port number.
- host uses IP address & part numbers to direct segment to appropriate socket

### Connectionless demultiplexing

### Connection-oriented demux

- TCP socket identified by 4-tuple:
  - source IP address
  - source port number
  - destination IP address
  - destination port number
- demultiplexing: the recivers uses all 4-tuple values to direct segments to appropriate psocket
- server hosts may support many simultaneous TCP sockets
  - Each sockets identified bt its own 4-tuple
- webservers have different sockets for each connecting client
  - non-persistent HTTP will have different socket for each request

#### Connection-oriented (TCP) demultiplexing example

## 3.3 Connectionless Transport UDP

### User DataGram Protocol [RFC 768]

- bare bone Internet communication protocol
- "best effort" service, UDP segments maybe lost & deliverd out-of-order to apps
- **connectionless**:
  - no handshaking
  - each UDP segment handled independently of others
- UDP use for
  - Streaming multimedia apps( loss tolerant, rate sensitive)
  - DNS
  - SimpleNetwork Management Protocol **SNMP**
- Reliable transfer over UDP:
  - add reliability at application layer
  - application-specific error recovery

### UDP segment header

Why UserDatagramProtocol?

- no connection establishment (can reduces delay)
- simple: no connection state at sender & reciever
- small header size
- co congestion controll: UDP can blash away as fast as desired.

### UDP checksum

- Goals: to detect errors(flipped bits) in transmitted segments

**Sender**:

- treat Segment contents, including header fields as sequences of 16-bit ints
- Checksum: addition(one's complement sum) of segment contents
- sender puts checksum value into UDP checksum field.

Reciever

- Compute checksum of recieved segment
- check if computed checksum equals checksum in field

see example slide18

### 3.4 Principles of reliable data transfer

- important networking topic
- important in application, transport, link layers
- Characteristics of an unreliable channel will determine the complexity of Reliable DataTransferProtocol ( RDT)

#### Getting started with ReliableDataTransfer(RDT)

Basic RDT functions:

- Send side
  - `rdt_send()`: called by the app-layer, passed data to deliver to reciever upper layer
  - `udt_send()`: called by rdt, transfer packets over unreliable channel to reciever
- Reciever side
  - 'rdt_rcv()`: called when packet arrives on rcv-side of channel
