## Week 11

# Ch6 Link layer, LANs: outline

- 6.4 LANs
  - addressing, ARP
  - Ethernet
  - switches
- 6.7 Web Request

## MAC address

- IP address <- -> Postal address
- MAC address <- -> Delivery specific address
  - Airport Codes, Shipping port ID, …
  - Used to identify destinations in a delivery link/LAN
- MAC address
  - Identify a destination link NIC in one LAN, burned in to NIC ROM.
  - ID of the NIC - portable.
  - 48 bit (six byte) MAC address, e.g. 1A-3F-B5-76-09-AD (hexidecimal(base 16) notation)

## LAN addresses and ARP

- Each adapter on LAN has a unique LAN address sl4
- MAC address allocation administered by IEEE
- manufacturer buys portion of MAC address space (to assure uniqueness), 
  - cisco: 00-18-89-, A8-9D-21-, …, 
  - Intel: 00-13-E8-, A0-88-69-, …
- Compare to IP address - analogy:
  - MAC address: Your name/ID
  - IP address: like your address
- MAC flat address  ➜ portability 
  - can move LAN card from one LAN to another
- IP hierarchical address not portable
  - address depends on IP subnet to which node is attached

## ARP: address resolution protocol

> How to determine interface MAC address, knowing IP address?

ARP table: each IP node (host, router) on LAN has table

- IP/MAC address mappings for some LAN nodes: `< IP address; MAC address; TTL>`
- TTL (Time To Live): time after which address mapping will be forgotten (typically 20 min)

### ARP protocol: same LAN

- Host A wants to send datagram to host B
  - Host B’s MAC address not in host A’s ARP table.
  - If host B is in the same subnet/LAN as host A, then
- Host A broadcasts ARP query packet, containing B's IP address
  - destination MAC address = `FF-FF-FF-FF-FF-FF`
  - all nodes in subnet/LAN receive ARP query
- Host B receives ARP packet, replies to A with its (B's) MAC address
  - frame sent to A’s MAC address (unicast)
  - Then host A can send datagrams to B with host B’s MAC address (unicast)

### Addressing: routing to another LAN

walkthrough: send datagram from A to B via R

- focus on addressing – at IP (datagram) and MAC layer (frame)
- assume A knows B’s IP address (how? e.g. B is a web server)
- assume A knows IP address of first hop router, R (how?)
- assume A knows R’s MAC address (how?)

diag sl8

## Addressing: routing to another LAN

sl 9

- A creates IP datagram with IP source A, destination B
- A creates link-layer frame with R's MAC addr as destination address, frame contains A-B IP datagram

sl 10

- Frame sent from A-R
- Frame recieve at R, datagram removed, passed up to IP

sl 11

- R forwards fatagram with IP source A, destination B
- R creates link-layer frame with B;s MAC address as destination address, frame contains A-B datagram

sl 12

- R forwards datagram with IP source A, destination B
- R creates link-layer frame with B's MAC addr as destination addr, Frame contain A-B datagram

sl 13

- R forwards fatagram with IP source A, destination B
- R creates link-layer frame with B's MAC addr as destination addr, Frame contain A-B datagram

## Ethernet

- “dominant” wired LAN technology: 
  - single chip, multiple speeds (e.g., Broadcom  BCM5761)
  - first widely used LAN technology
  - simpler, cheap
  - kept up with speed race: 10 Mbps – 10 Gbps 

sl 15 diag

### Ethernet: physical topology

- bus: popular through mid 90s
  - all nodes in same collision domain (can collide with each other)
- star: prevails today
  - active switch in center
  - each “spoke” runs a (separate) Ethernet protocol (nodes do not collide with each other)

### Ethernet frame structure

- sending adapter encapsulates IP datagram (or other network layer protocol packet) in Ethernet frame
- preamble: 
  - 7 bytes with pattern 10101010 followed by one byte with pattern 10101011
  - used to synchronize receiver, sender clock rates
  
### Ethernet: unreliable, connectionless

- connectionless: no handshaking between sending and receiving NICs
- unreliable (but has error detection with CRC): receiving NIC doesn't send acks or nacks to sending NIC
  - data in dropped frames recovered only if initial sender uses higher layer rdt (e.g., TCP), otherwise dropped data lost
- Ethernet’s MAC protocol: CSMA/CD with binary backoff (no longer)

### 802.3 Ethernet standards: link & physical layers

- many different Ethernet standards
  - common MAC protocol and frame format
  - different speeds: 2 Mbps, 10 Mbps, 100 Mbps, 1Gbps, 10 Gbps, 40 Gbps, 100Gbps
  - different physical layer media: fiber, cable

sl 20

## Switches and VLANS

### Ethernet switch

- link-layer device: takes an active role
  - store, forward Ethernet frames
  - examine incoming frame’s MAC address, selectively forward  frame to one-or-more outgoing links when frame is to be forwarded on segment
- transparent
  - hosts are unaware of presence of switches
- plug-and-play, self-learning
  - switches do not need to be configured

### Switch: multiple simultaneous transmissions

- hosts have dedicated, direct connection to switch
- switches buffer packets
- Ethernet protocol used on each incoming link, but no collisions; full duplex
  - each link is its own collision domain
- **switching**: A-to-A’ and B-to-B’ can transmit simultaneously, without collisions 

### Switch forwarding table

- Q: how does switch know A’ reachable via interface 4, B’ reachable via interface 5?
  - A: each swith has a switch table, each entry has
    - MAC addr of host, inteface to reach host, time stamp
    - looks like a routing table
- Q: How are entries created, maintained in the switch table?
  - A: Something like a routing protocol

sl 24

### Switch: self-learning

- switch learns which hosts can be reached through which interfaces
  - when frame received, switch “learns”  location of sender: incoming LAN segment
  - records sender/location pair in switch table

### Switch: frame filtering/forwarding

when  frame received at switch:

1. record incoming link, MAC address of sending host
2. index switch table using MAC destination address
3. logic:

> if entry found for destination
>
> then forward frame on interface indicated by entry
> 
> else flood  /* forward on all interfaces except interface */

### Self-learning, forwarding: example

- frame destination, A’, location unknown: `flood`
- destination A location known: selectively send on just one link

sl 27

### Interconnecting switches

- self-learning switches can be connected together:

sl 28

- Q: Sending from A-G, How does S1 know to forward fram gestined to G viea S4 and S3?
  - A: Self learning (same as single switch case)

### Self-learning multi-switch example

- Suppose C sendg, forwarding: example

sl 29

- Q: show switch tables and packet forwarding in S1,S2,S3,S4

```md
frame destination, A’, location unknown:
Interconnecting switches
self-learning switches can be connected together:
Self-learning s frame to I, I responds to C
```

### Institutional network

sl 30

### Switches vs. routers

- both are store-and-forward: 
  - routers: network-layer devices (examine network-layer headers)
  - switches: link-layer devices (examine link-layer headers)
- both have forwarding tables:
  - routers: compute tables using routing algorithms, IP addresses
  - switches: learn forwarding table using flooding, learning, MAC addresses 

## Synthesis: a day in the life of a web request

- journey down protocol stack complete!
  - application,
  - transport,
  - network,
  - link
- putting-it-all-together: synthesis!
  - goal: identify, review, understand protocols (at all layers) involved in seemingly simple scenario: requesting www page
  - scenario: student attaches laptop to campus network, requests/receives www.google.com 

### A day in the life: scenario

sl 34

### A day in the life… connecting to the Internet

- connecting laptop needs to get its own IP address, addr of first-hop router, addr of DNS server: use DHCP
- DHCP request encapsulated in UDP, encapsulated in IP, encapsulated in 802.3 ethernet
- Ethernet frame broadcase (dest:FFFFFFFF) on LAN, recieved at router running DHCP server
- Ethernet demuxed to IP, demuxed, UDP demuxed to DHCP

### A day in the life… connecting to the Internet

- DHCP server formulates DHCP ACK containing
  - client’s IP address,
  - IP address of first-hop router for client,
  - name & IP address of DNS server 
- Encapsulation at DHCP  server, frame forwarded(switch learning) through LAN, demiltiplexing at client
- DHCP client reciveces HDCP ACK reply
  - allocated private IP address
  - require NAT

A day in the life… ARP (before DNS, before HTTP)
before sending HTTP request, need IP address of www.google.com:  DNS
A day in the life… using DNS

### A day in the life…TCP connection carrying HTTP

sl 39

- Routing Protocol: RIP, OSPF/IS-S
- BGP
- to send HTTP request, client first opens TCP socket to web Server
- TCP SYN segment (step 1 in 3-way handshake) inter-domain routed to web server
- web server responds with TCP SYNACK (step 2 in 3-way handshake)
- TCP connection established!

### A day in the life… HTTP request/reply

sl 40

- web page displayed
- switch Fabrics: Mem, Bus, Crossbar
- Queueing Discipline FIFO, Pro, RR, WRR
- HTTP request sent into TCP socket
- IP datagram containing HTTp request routed to url
- Web server respond with HTTP reply
- TCP FLow/Congestion controll
