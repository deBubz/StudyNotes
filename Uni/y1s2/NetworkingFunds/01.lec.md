## 1.1 What is the Internet

### Internet

Its a network of Billions of Connected devices. Where `hosts(End Systems)` are running `network apps`, connected via `communication links` such as fiber, copper, radio, satellite

- Also considered as a **network of networks** (mobile, home, institutional)
- Data is transmitted through **communication protocols** (http, tcp/ip, 802.11)
- For ease of development, there are **internet standards** such as
  - RFC: request for comments
  - IETF: Internet engineering task force

### Protocols

Defines the **format and order** of messages sent and recieved among network entities, and **action** taken on message transmission, reciepts

> Request > Response
>
> Human protocols: `transport, trading, agreements, relay races`

## 1.2 Network Edges

- **Network Edges**:
  - Hosts Clients, Server, cloud
- **Network Core** Interconnected router, Network of networks

### Access Network: Digital Subscriber Line (DSL)

Use existing **dedicated** telephone line to transmit data at different frequencies (voice, data).

### Access Network: Cable Network

Use Existing TV cable to transfer data in differenct frequency bands(**frequency diversion multiplexing**)

- using HFC Cable - Hybrid Fibre Coax. Asymetric structure allows 30mbps downstream, 2mbps upstream (download, upload?)
- `Cable Network` is a network of cables connected to ISP routers
- All Homes `shares access network` to the cable header

### Access Network: Home

Your network at home, consist of *wireless devices*, Wireless Access Point, Router, Firewall (often combined into 1 box)

### Access Network: Enterprize (ethernet)

Typically Used in Unis, Companies with transmission rates ranges form 10mbps upto 10gbps. End systems are often connected via ethernet.

## Wireless Access Networks

Where end systems connects to a router(acess point) wirelessly(WiFi). This includes:

- Wireless LAN: within a single building(30m), often using the **802.11b/g/n protocol**
- WideArea Wireless Access: provided by telcos(cellular) operators with the range of 10km. 3g - 4g, LTE 

### Physical Media

Lotsa werds

- **bit**: propegate between transmitter/reciever pairs
- **Guided Media**(physical linking cables)
  - `Twisted Pair(TP)`: two insulated copper wire(ethernet), cat5 1gbps, cat6
  - `Coaxial Fibre`: two concentric copper conductors, bidirectional, HFC, multiple channes on cable
  - `Fibre Optic Cable`: SUPA FEST, glass fibre carying light pulses, Low impedance
- **Unguided Media**
  - No wires(radio), signal carried in the electromangnetic spectrum
  - prone to physical interferance (obstruction by objects, reflections)
  - `Terestial Microwave`
  - `W-LAN` WiFi
  - `Wide-Area` Cellular network
  - `Satellite`

## NBN National broadband Network (QnA time)

- What Access Technologies used in NBN
- What are the data rate for each Tech
- Cost for each tech?
- Pros and cons

## 1.3 Network Core

- **Mesh**(network) of interconnected routers
- Something `packet switching`:
  - `packets` bundle of data to be transmitted
  - Forward packets from one router to the next, from source to dentination
  - Each packet transmitted at full link capacity

### Packet Switching: Store & Forward

```md
L       Bits per package(pack size)
R       Transfer speed
```

From source to destination: Total time is `L/R` seconds to transfer `L` package into link at `R` speed.
**Store and forward** means ALL packages must arrive at router before it can be transmitted to the next link.

> End-end delay = `2L/R` ??
>
> Times taken for a packet to be transmitted from source to destination

### Packet Switching: Queuing Delay/ Loss

`packet delay, loss` occurs when the arrival rate to links exeed the transmission rate of link.

- With multiple connections, packets will queue up & wait to be transmitted.
- Packet can be dropped if the Memory Queue is filled up.
  
### two main functions() of the Network Core

- `Forwarding` Move Packets from router Input to appropriate Router Output
- `Routing`: using routing algo to determine packets destination

> So from source to destination, Routing is used to determine the route, and then forwarded to the next link/destination

### Alternative Core: Circuit Switching

- End-end resources allocated, reserved for call between a specific source-destination (dedicated route)
- No sharing resources -> no packet loss
- commonly used in traditional Telephone networks( redundant info?)
- **Two types of Circuit Switching**
  - `TDM` Time Division Multiplexing 
  - `FDM` Frequency Division Multiplexing
- **Packet Switching** v **Circuit Switching**
  - `Packet` More Users, Great for Burtsy data(not constant), Resource Sharing, Simpler less setup. Prone to packetloss, need protocol for congestion cntroll 
  - `Circuit` Better for Audio/Video, No packetLoss

## Internet Structure: network of networks

- End systems connects to the internet via `access ISP` (internet service provider)
- Access ISPs then must be interconnected so 2 hosts from different ISP can connect to eachother
- => **Networks of networks** is very complex (growth is often driven by economical, national policies)
