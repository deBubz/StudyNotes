## 2.3 Electronic mail (SMTP, POP3, IMAP)

### Electonic mail

Email consists of 3 major component

- User agent:
  - Users, whom can read, compose, edit, send emails
- Mail Servers:
  - Mailbox: containing users email
  - Message Queue: of out going email to be sent
- Protocols
  - SMPT: protocol between Mail servers to send mail messages
  - POP3, IMAP, HTTP

#### SMTP [RFC 2821]

Simple Mail Transfer Protocol

- Uses TCP to transfer email from Client-Server, port 25
- Direct Transfer: sending server -> recieving server
- Three phrases of transfer:
  1. Handshaking (greeting)
  2. transfer of messages
  3. closure
- command/response interaction (like http)
  - commands ASCII text
  - response status code & phrase
- Messages must be in 7bit ASCI

Steps in sending email SMTP

1. mail is composed by UserAgent and sent to MailServer
2. MailServer opens TCP connection to destination MailServer
3. SMTP client send messafe over the TCP connection
4. Destination MailServer place message into destination UserAgent

Mail Access Protoco;

- **SMTP**: handles delivery/storage to the reciever's server
- Mail Access Protocol: retrieval from server
  - PostOfficeProtocol POP[RFC 1939]: handles authorization & downloads
  - InternetMailAccessProtocol IMAP [RFC 1730]: more features, inclides manipulation of stored messages on the Server
  - HyperTextTransferProtocol HTTP: gmail, hotmail, yahoomail

#### POP3 and IMAP

POP3

- POP3 download & deletemode. something about not able to rereal emails if you change client
- POP3 download & keep: coppies of messages on different clients
- POP3 is stateless across sessions

IMAP
- keep all messages in 1 place: at server
- download & keep
- Allow user to organise messages in folders
- keep user state across sessions
  - name of folders and mapping between message ID & folder name

#### More about SMTP

- SMTP uses persistent connections
- SMTP requires messages (headers & body) to be in 7 bit ASCII
- SMTP server uses CRLF.CRLF to dertermine the end of message

Comparing with HTTP

- Http:pull
- SMTP push
- POP3, IMAP: push or pull?
- both hace ASCII commands/response interaction, status code
- HTTP: each obj  encapsulated in its own response message
- SMTP: multiple objs sent in multipart message

### Domain Name System

mapping url into IP address

- Distributed Database: implemented in heirachy of many `name servers`
- Application-layer protocol: hosts, name servers communicate to `resolve` names (addr/names translation)

#### DNS services, structure

DNS services

- hostname to IP address translation
- host aliasing
  - canonnical, alias names
  - one IP address correspond to multiple hostnames `ddg.gg`
- mail server aliasing
- load distribution
  - replicated WebServers: many IP address = one name

Why not Centralize DNS

- single point of failure
- traffic volume
- distatnt centralized db
- maintenance

> it does not scale

#### DNS distributed, heirachial db

What the fuck see page 158

- Root DNS server is optional
- Top Level Domain TLD servers
  - responsible for com, org,net,edu,aero
  - top level country domain
  - NetworkSolutions vmaintain servers for .com TLD
  - Educause for .edu TLD
- Authoritative DNS servers
  - organisations own DNS servers, providing authoritative hostname to ip mappings for organization's named host
  - can be maintained by organization/service provider

Local DNS name server

- does not strictly beling to heirachy
- each ISP has one ( default name server)
- When host makes DNS query, it is sent to local DNS server
  - has local cache of recent name-address translation pairs
  - acts as proxy, forwards query into heirachy

### Socket Programming with UDP & TCP

- GOAL: build client/server applications that communicate using sockets
- Socket: door btween application process & network process in the 5 layer stack
- 2 type of sockets for transport services
  - UDP: unreliable data gram
  - TCP: reliable, byte stream-oriented
- App Example:
  1. client reads a line of char from keyboard & send to server
  2. server recieves & convert char to uppercase
  3. server sent modified data to convert chars to uppercase

#### With UDP

- UDP means no 'connection' btween client & server
  - no hand shaking before sending data
  - sender explicitly attatches IP destination address & port # to each packet
  - reciever extracts sender IP adress & port # from recieved packet
- UDP: transmitted data maybe lost or recieved out-of-order
- Application viewpoint: UDP provide unreliable transfer of group of bytes (datagrams) btween client/server

```py
# py UDP server 
# to convert msg from client to uppercase then return message
from socket import *

sPort = 12000
sSocket = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_DGRAM)

sSocket.bind(('', sPort))
print("server iz up boye")

while True:
    message , clAddress = sSocket.recvfrom(2048)
    moddedMsg = message.decode().upper()
    sSocket.sendto(moddedMsg.encode(), clAddress)
```

```py
# py UDP client
# push send input to UDp server to be converted
from socket import *

sName = 'hostname'
sPort = 12000
clSocket socket(AF_INET, SOCK_DGRAM)
msg = raw_input('input lowercase txt')

clSocket.sendto(msg.encode(), sName, sPort)
moddedMsg, sAddr = clSocket.recvfrom(2048)
print moddedMsg.decode()
clSocket.close()
```

#### With TCp

- Server must run first
  - server must first create sockets(door) that answers contact requests
- Clients contact sever by
  - creating TCP socket, specifying IP, port, number of server process
  - when client creates socket: clTCP establish connection to servTcp
  - when contacted by client, servTCP creates new socket for serv process to communocates with that client
    - allow serv to talk with multiple clients
    - source port number used to distinguish clients ( ch3 )
- Application Viewpoint: TCP provide reliable, in-order byte-stream transfer("pipe") btween client/server

```py
# TCP serv
from socket import *
sPort = 12000
sSocket = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM)

sSocket.bind(('', sPort))
sSocket.listen(1)

print 'TCP is up Boye'

while True:
    conSocket, addr = sSocket.accept()
    sentence = conSocket.recv(1024).decode().upper()
    conSocket.sent(sentence.encode())
    conSocket.close()
```

```py
# TCP client
from socket import *
sName = "servername"
sPort = 12000

clSocket = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM)
clSocket.connect((sName,sPort))
sentence = input("input sometext")

clSocket.send(sentence.encode)
moddedSentence = clSocket.recv(1024)

print('From Server: ', moddedSentence.decode())
clSocket.close()
```
