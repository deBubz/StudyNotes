# Control Plane Part 2

## OutLine

- 5.3 Intra-As routing in the Internet: OSPF
- 5.4 routing among the ISPs: BGP
- 5.6 ICMP - The Internet Controll Message Protocol
- 5.7 Network management and SNMP

## Making routing scalable

- all the routing study so far focused on 'graphs'
  - all routers are identical
  - 'flat' network structure
- All theory, not neccecarity accurate in real life scenario

**scale**: with billions of destinations:
- can’t store all destinations in routing tables!
- routing table exchange would swamp links! 

**Administrative autonomy**

- Internet is a network of networks
- Each network admin may want to control routing in its own network.

## Internet approach to scalable routing

aggregate routers into regions known as “autonomous systems” (AS) (domains)

- **Intra-AutonomousSystem routing**
  - routing among hosts, routers in the same AS(network)
  - all routers in AS run `same` intra-domain protocol
  - routers in different AS can run different intra-domain routing prorocol
  - gateway router at edge of its own AS, as link(s) to router(s) in other Autonomous Systems
- **Inter-AutonomousSystem routing**
  - routing among Autonomous Systems
  - Gateway Perform inter-domain routing(as well as intra)

### Interconnected ASes

See s5

- forwarding table  configured by both intra- and inter-AS routing algorithm
  - intra-AS routing determine entries for destinations within AS
  - inter-AS & intra-AS determine entries for external destinations

### Intra-AS Routing

- Routing / Forwarding
  - Routing in a host
  - Routing and forwarding table
  - Routing aggregation and 
  - Longest prefix matching
- Intra-AS Routing protocols
  - OSPF etc

## Route in a host

see s7

## IP Routing: routing table in a router

see s8 may need to revise w6, w7

## Hierarchical addressing: route aggregation

see s9

## Longest prefix matching

see s10

## Intra-AS Routing Protocols

- also known as interior gateway protocols (IGP)
- most common intra-AS routing protocols:
  - RIP: Routing Information Protocol
  - IGRP: Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (Cisco proprietary for decades, until 2016)
  - `OSPF: Open Shortest Path First`
  - IS-IS protocol essentially same as OSPF

Where RIP, IGRP uses Distance Vector Alg and OSPF and IS-S uses LinkState

## OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)

- “open”: publicly available
- uses Link-state algorithm - **Dijkstra**
  - link state packet dissemination
  - topology map at each node
- route computation using Dijkstra’s algorithm
- router floods OSPF link-state advertisements to all other routers in entire AS
  - carried in OSPF messages directly over IP (rather than TCP or UDP
  - link state: for each attached link
- IS-IS routing protocol: nearly identical to OSPF

### OSPF “advanced” features (optional)

- security: all OSPF messages authenticated (to prevent malicious intrusion) 
- multiple same-cost paths allowed (only one path in RIP)
- for each link, multiple cost metrics for different TOS (e.g., satellite link cost set low for best effort ToS; high for real-time ToS)
- integrated uni- and multi-cast support: 
  - Multicast OSPF (MOSPF) uses same topology data base as OSPF
- hierarchical OSPF in large domains.

### Hierarchical OSPF

see s14 

- two-level hierarchy: local area, backbone.
  - link-state advertisements only in each area 
  - each nodes has detailed area topology; 
  - Each area runs an independent link state routing.
- backbone routers: Backbone area ’0’
  - core to all other areas.
- area border routers: “aggregate” networks in own area, 
  - advertise to Area 0, through to other Areas.
- boundary routers: connect to other AS’es.

## Inter-AS tasks

- suppose router in AS1 receives datagram destined outside of AS1:
  - router should forward packet to gateway router, but which one?
- AS1 mustL
  1. Learn which destination are reachable through AS2, which thorugh AS3?

### Internet inter-AS routing: BGP

- BGP (Border Gateway Protocol): the de facto inter-domain routing protocol
  - “glue that holds the Internet together”
  - Based on Distance Vector Routing Algorithm
- BGP provides each AS a means to:
  - eBGP: obtain subnet reachability information from neighboring ASes
  - iBGP: propagate reachability information to all AS-internal routers.
  - determine “good” routes to other networks based on reachability information and policy
- allows subnet to advertise its existence to rest of Internet: “I am here”

## eBGP, iBGP connections

See s19

### BGP basics

- **BGP session**: 2 peer BGP routers exchange BGP messages over semi-permanent TCp connection:
  - advertising paths to different destination network prefixes (BGP is a path vector protocol)
- when AS3 gateway router 3a advertises path AS3,X to AS2 gateway router 2c:
  - AS3 promises to AS2 it will forward datagrams towards X

### Path attributes and BGP routes

- advertised prefix includes BGP attributes 
  - prefix + attributes = “route”
- two important attributes:
- AS-PATH: list of ASes through which prefix advertisement has passed
  - NEXT-HOP: indicates specific internal-AS router to next-hop AS
- Policy-based routing:
  - gateway receiving route advertisement uses import policy to accept/decline path (e.g., never route through AS Y).
- AS policy also determines whether to advertise path to other other neighboring ASes

### BGP path advertisement

see s22

- AS2 router 2c recieves path advertisement `AS3,X` (via eBGP) from AS3 and router 3a.
- Based on AS2 policy, AS2 router 2c accepts path AS3,X, propagates (via iBGP) to all AS2 routers
- Based on AS2 policy, AS2 router 2a advertises (via eBGP) path `AS2, AS3, X` to AS1 router 1c.

## BGP path advertisement

see s 23

- gateway router may lean about multiple paths to destination:
  - AS1 gateway router 1c leans path `AS2, AS3, X` from 2a
  - AS1 gateway router 1c learns paths `AS3, X` from 3a.
  - Based on policy, AS1 gateway router 1c chooses paths `AS3, X and advertises path within AS1 via iBGP`

## BGP messages

- BGP messages exchanged between peers over TCP connection
- BGP messages:
- OPEN: opens TCP connection to remote BGP peer and authenticates sending BGP peer
  - UPDATE: advertises new path (or withdraws old)
  - KEEPALIVE: keeps connection alive in absence of UPDATES; also ACKs OPEN request
  - NOTIFICATION: reports errors in previous msg; also used to close connection

## BGP, OSPF, forwarding table entries

see 25, 26

## BGP route selection

- router may learn about more than one route to destination AS, selects route based on:
  1. local preference value attribute: policy decision
  2. shortest AS-PATH 
  3. closest NEXT-HOP router: hot potato routing
  4. additional criteria 

## Hot Potato Routing

see s28

- 2d learns (via iBGP) it can route to X via 2a or 2c
- hot potato routing: choose local gateway that has least intra-domain cost (e.g., 2d chooses 2a, even though more AS hops to X): don’t worry about inter-domain cost!

## BGP: achieving policy via advertisements

see 29, 30

Suppose an ISP only wants to route traffic to/from its customer networks (doesnot want to carry transit traffic between other ISPs)

- A advertises path to Aw and to B and to C
  -  B,C advertises to ther customers x, y
- B `chooses not to avertise` BAw to C:
  - w, y are NOT B`s customers
- C does not learn about CBAw path
  - C will route CAw(not using B) to get to w
- x is `dual-homed`: atteteched to two networks
  - if x advertise C to B
  - B -> C -> y traffic could go through x
- `policy to enforce: x` does not want route from B to C via x
  - ..so x will not advertise to B a route to C
  - .. so x will not carry BCy traffic 

## Why different Intra-, Inter-AS routing ? 

- policy: 
  - intra-AS: single admin, so no policy decisions needed
  - inter-AS: admin wants control (using policy) over how its traffic routed, who routes through its net. 
- performance: 
  - intra-AS: can focus on performance
  - inter-AS: policy may dominate over performance
- scale:
  - hierarchical routing saves table size, reduced update traffic
 
## ICMP: internet control message protocol

- used by hosts & routers to communicate network-level information
  - error reporting: unreachable host, network, port, protocol
  - echo request/reply (used by ping)
- network-layer “above” IP:
  - ICMP msgs carried in IP datagrams
- ICMP message: type, code plus first 8 bytes of IP datagram causing error

## Traceroute and ICMP

- source sends series of UDP segments to destination
  - first set has TTL =1
  - second set has TTL=2, etc.
  - unlikely port number
- when datagram in nth set arrives to nth router:
  - router discards datagram and sends source ICMP message TTL expired (type 11, code 0)
  - ICMP message include name of router & IP address
  - when ICMP message arrives, source records RTTs
- stopping criteria
  - UDP segment eventually arrives at destination host
  - destination returns ICMP "port unreachabble" message (type3, code3)
  - source stops

## What is network management?

- autonomous systems (aka “network”): 1000s of interacting hardware/software components
- other complex systems requiring monitoring, control:
  - jet airplane
  - nuclear power plant
  - others?

> **Network Management** includes the deployment, intergration and coordination of the hardware, software, and human elements to monitor, test, poll, configure, analyze, evaluate, and control the network and element resources to meet the real-time, operational performance, and quality of service requirements at a reasonable bost. 

## Infrastructure for network management

See s37

## SNMP protocol

see s39

Two ways to convey MIB info, commands:

- request/response mode
- trap mode

## SNMP protocol: message types

| Message Type | Function|
|---|---|
| GetRequest, GetNextRequest, GetBulkRequest| manager-agent: get data (data instance, next data in list, block of data)|
|Inform Request| manager-manager: heres MIB val|
|SetRequest|manager-agent: set MIB value|
|Response|agent-manager: value, response to request|
|Trap|agent-manager: inform manager of exeptional event|
