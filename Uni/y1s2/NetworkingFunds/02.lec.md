## Operations: protocol layers, Service models

### Protocol Layers

Since networks are very complext and usually consist of many "pieces":
   - Host
   - Routers
   - Media Links
   - Applications
   - Protocols
   - Hardware, software

How are they organized?

- Something about **layers**:
  - Tasks are broken down by steps
  - Layered horizontally:
    - Each layer represent a service each rely on services provided by the layer below

#### 5 Layer Internet Protocol Stack

1. **Physical**: cables
2. **Link**: data transfering between neighbouring network elements
3. **Network**: Routing of datagrams from source to destination
4. **Transport**: process-process data transfer
5. **Application**: Supporting network applications

There is also a 7 layer ISO OSI model but its not tested.

#### Why use a Layering model

- It provides a structured way to discuss system components.
- Provides modularity, which makes it easier to update each components

#### Encapsulation

Even though the source and destination uses the 5 layers stack, link switch and routers uses different stacks.

Encasulation means, the application-layer message will be **encapsulated(grouped up)** with some header information to create a **transport layer segment**. The header information will be used by the recieving transport-layer to further process(deliver to the correct application) the message.

> Transport-layer segment encapsulate the application-layer message, which adds header information suchas source and destination end system address

### Performance: delay, loss, prevention

Loss and delay occur when packets waits in queue in links to be transfered

Four source of delays are

- **nodal processing**: packets processing time in reading headers to futther determine the next link/ destination
- **queuing delay**: 
  - time waiting at link for all packets to arrive.
  - Congestion time from multiple packets
- **transmission delay**:
  - Size/Speed, L/R, Link/Rate
- **propagation delay**:
  - Length pf physical link/ Propagation speed(~2*10^8 m/sec)
