## 5.1. Intro - Network-layer functions

\* **RECALL**: 2 network layer functions

- In the **DATA plane**: `forwarding()`: move packets from router’s input to appropriate router output
- In the **Control Plane**: `routing()`: determine route teken by packets form source to destination.

**Two Aproach** to structuring network control plane:

- per-router control (traditional method)
  - Routing algorithm is run at every router
  - each router's routing/forwarding functions are **self contained**
  - OSPF and PGC protocols
- locically centralized control (software defined networking)
  - a centralized controller calculates and distributes forwarding talbes to be used by each router
  - the **centralized controller** interact(configure/ manage flow tables) with each routers through their **Control Agents** via a well-defined protocol.
  - CA do not interact with each other, only carry out the Controllers commands.

> **The Control-plane**: The network wide logic that **controls**:
>
> - how datagrams are forwarded between routers along an end-end path
> - how networl-layer components and services are configured and managed

**Chapter Goal**: study how forwarding and flow tables are comupted, maintained, installed

```md
TODO list:

Data Plane:
These table specify local data-plane forwarding behaviour of a router:
- forwarding table (destination based forwarding)
- flow table (generalized forwarding)

Forwarding Type:
- Generalized: for ward packets to a router's output port
- dropping packet, replicating packet and or rewriting layer 2,3,4 of the packet's header field.
```

## 5.2. Routing Protocol/ Routing Algorithms

**Routing protocol goal**: determine “good”(cheapest, then shortest) paths/ routes, from Senders to Recievers.

- **Good Routing features**: "shortest", "fastest", "least congested" and "cheapest"
- Used to form well-defined sequence of routers that packets will traverse through from Host-Reciever.
- Top10 networking fundamentals concept

### Graph Abstraction of network

F5.3 pp405

To formulate routing problems

- Graph: `G = (N,E)` where"
- N = an array of routers(Nodes)
  - Also where path forwarding decisions are made.
- E = an array notating links(Edge = pair of nodes) of the router.
  - Each edge also may have a cost value
  - If a set of 2 nodes does not belong to Edge the cost will be
    - c(x,y) = infinite
  - ATM only look at undirected grapsh(no set direction for each edge)

### Graph abstraction: costs

- Cost of link notation: `c(a,b) = 5` edge cost of node and b is 5
- Means the cost of link between router a and b is 5
  - often related to distance/ delay
  - (inversely) related to bandwith and congestion.

**Question**: What is the cheapest and shortest path between a and b?

- depends on the algorithm

### Routing algorithm classification

**Centralized** routing algorithm

- determine routing using the complete global knowledge of the ntW
- require the algos to have information all nodes/costs as input before the calculation
- `Link-state` algo

**Decentralized** routing algos

- calculation is carried out in an iterrative, distributed maner by the router
- no node has full info of all other links, just their neigbouring connected links
- Each node maintain an vector of estimates of the cost/disctance to all other nodes in the network.

- **global** or **centralized**:
  - all routers have complete topology, link cost info
  - “link state” algorithms
- **decentralized** or **distributed**: 
  - router knows physically-connected neighbors, link costs to neighbors `wtf`
iterative process of computation, exchange of info with neighbors
  - “distance vector” algorithms

Another way to classify routing algos

- **Static** routing
  - Changes slowly overtime, often due to a person manually changing the link cost
- **Dynamic** routing
  - Changes the routhing paths as the network load or topology
  - can run periodicaly or as a response for link cost change

**Question** Static or Dynamic?

- **Static**:

- **Dynamic**
  - routes change more quickly due to:
  - periodicly due to algorithm update
  - in response to link cost changes

### 5.2.1 link-state routing algorithm

**Link state**: 

- Centralised routing where all network **topology** and **link cost** are **known** to other nodes
- Achieved by having each node broadcast link state packets to other nodes in the network, with each link-state packet containing the ID and cost of its attatched link. This is achieved by a **link-state broadcast** algos with the OSP protocol


```md
Centralized routing algorithm with Global network topology information
--- Dijkstra’s algorithm
```

- computes least cost paths from one node (‘source”) to all other nodes, gives **forwarding table** for that node.
- **iterative**: after k iterations, know least cost path to k destinations.

#### Dijsktra’s algorithm

- Iterative
- has the porp that af ther the `k`th iteration:
  - The least cost paths are known to `k` destination nodes
  - among the least cost path to all destination nodes, `k` paths will have the `k` smallest cost.

Notation:

- `D(v)` : cost of least-cost path from the source to dest(`v`) in this iteration in the algo
- `p(v)` : previous node (neighbour of `v`) along the **current** least-cost path from source to `v`
- `N'`: subset of nodes; '`v` is in `N'` if the least-cost path from the source to `v` is definatively known

The Centralized routing algo (Dijkstra?) consist on an **init** step follow by a **loop**. The loop will execure as many times as the number of nodes in the network. The algo will then resukt in the shortest paths from souce `u` to **EVERY** other nodes to the network

1. Initialization
   - `N' = {u}
   - for all nodes v
     - if v adjacent to u
       - then D(v) - c(u,v)
     - else D(v) = infinite 
2. **Loop**
   - Find w not in N' such that D(w) is a minimum
   - add w to N'
   - update D(v) for all adjacent to w and not in N':
     - `D(v) = min ( D(v), D(w) + c(w,v))`
   - // new cost to v is either old cost to v or known shortest path cost to w plus cost from w-v.
3. **Until all nodes is in N'**

**NOTE** see slide 11 - 12

Slide 15 shows the least cost path & forwarding talbe for node `u`

`Dijkstra’s algorithm, discussion` Optional slide 16 pp 410 - 411

### 5.2.2 Distance vector (DV) algorithm

- **Decentralized** routing algorithm:
  - DV is iterative, asynchronous, and distributed.
    - **Distributed** each node recieves some info its directly attatched neighbors, calculates and distribute the results back to the neighbour
    - **Itterative** because the process will run continuously until no more info is sent between neighbours.
    - **Asyncronous** does not require nodes can operate independently from each other (no lockstep)
  - Rely on neighbour's route to destination
- E.g Syd - Brisbane:
  - Use what route & how far it is: Ask neighbouring links:
    - via Newcastle     - 200 + 800    = 1000km
    - via Orange        - 300 + 1000   = 1300km
    - via Goulbourn     - 200 + 1200   = 1400km
    - via Wollonggong   - 100 + 1100   = 1200km

#### **Bellman-Ford equation** (dynamic programming)

or The Dislance vector Algo

let `dx(y)` is the cost of least-cost path from x to y.
Then the least cost are realated to the Bellman-Ford equasion:
- `dx(y) = {min v + dv(y)}`
- **Where**:
  - `min v` : is the equation taken over all of x's neighbours
  u

#### Bellman-Ford example: u -> z

Slide 20

### Distance vector algorithm (2)

- `Dx(y)` = estimate of least cost from x to y
  - x maintains  distance vector `Dx = [Dx(y): y є N ]`
- node x:
  - knows cost to each neighbor v: c(x,v)
  - maintains its neighbors’ distance vectors. For each neighbor v, x maintains
  - `Dv = [Dv(y): y є N ]`

- **key idea**:
  - from time-to-time, each node sends its own distance vector estimate to neighbors
  - when x receives new DV estimate from neighbor, it updates its own DV using B-F equation:
  - `Dx(y) <- minv{ c(x,v) + Dv(y)} for each node`
  - `y є N`

**Distance** vector algorithm is:

- **iterative**, **asynchronous**: each local iteration caused by: 
  - local link cost change
  - DV update message from neighbor
- **distributed**:
  - each node notifies neighbors only when its DV changes
  - neighbors then notify their neighbors if necessary
- **Each node** will loop these steps:
  1. **wait** for change in local link cost/ or neighbour message
  2. **recompute** estimates
  3. if DV to any destination has changed, **notify** neighbours

`Optional see 24 - 25`

#### Distance Vector: Link cost changes

- when a node detects local **link cost change**
- routing info is updated, and recalculate the **Distance Vector**
- if Distance Vector changes, neighbours will be notified
- " good news travels fast"

different scenario

- Nodes detects local link cost change
- `bad news travels slow` - count to infinity problem
- goes through multiple iterations before algorithm stablizes: "read txtbook wtf"

**Soliution**:

- if Z routes through Y to get to X:
  - Z tells Y iys (Z's) distance to X is infinite (so Y won't route to X via Z)
- But will this completely solve count to infinity problem?

### Comparison of LS and DV algorithms

- **message complexity**
  - LS: with n nodes, E links, O(nE) msgs sent  
  - DV: exchange between neighbors only (convergence time varies)
- speed of convergence
  - LS: O(n^2) algorithm requires O(nE) msgs (may have oscillations)
  - DV: convergence time varies
    - may be routing loops
    - count-to-infinity problem
- **Robustness**: in case of router malfunctioning:
  - LS: nodes may advertise incorrect **link cost** and each node computes only its own table.
  - DV: can advertise inccorect path cost. Each node's table used by others - error may propagate through network
