> Consider an application that transmits data at a steady rate (for example, the sender generates an N-bit unit of data every k time units, where k is small and fixed). Also, when such an application starts, it will continue running for a relatively long period of time.

1. `circuit-switching` data is transfered **constantly** overtime. Therefore alocating specific resource for the app will prevent packet loss.
2. congestion protocol is reccomended if using `packet-switching` to prevent packet-loss while queuing multiple tasks at a network link.
