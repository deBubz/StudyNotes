# Requirement Process

## Objectives

- Understand the requirement process in the syst development process
- Its stages and activities
- Identify stakeholders and understand who they are

## Topics

### System Development process

**Agile dev process**: development method where solutions evolved through collaborations. it promotes adaptive planning, evolutionary development, eaerly delivery, continuous inprovement.
    - stuff bout **scrums**

**Waterfall dev process**: sequential design, progress is seen as a flowing steadily downwards through different phases

#### Requirement process

- Req Gathering process:
  - **Orderly process** to corretly complete complete requiremnets, a Requirement process is needed.
  - **Process** are steps of phases in the SDLC
  - its a structure imposed on the SDLC
  - each phases procudes deliverables
- steps of requirements process
  - Negotiation, prioritising & Management
    - Planning & Elicitation
      - Modelling & Analysis
        - Specification & Documentation
          - Validation & Inspection
- Requirement process includes
  - Stages/Phases
  - Activities & Tasks
  - Techniques & Tools
  - Identifying Stakeholders & their needs
  - Doccument the requirements in a **model** that allow
    - Analysis
    - communication
    - subsequent implementation

#### Requirements Engineering

Refers to the Process of defining, doccumenting & maintaining requirements and to the subfields of systems engineering & software engineering concerened with this process `wtf`

- Requirement Quality: `SMART`
  - **S**pecific, Simple: generic and free from interpretation
  - **M**easurable, Managable
  - **A**ttainable
  - **R**ealistic
  - **T**ime-bound
- Types of Requirements
  - **Functional**: must contain essential functions
  - **Non-Functional** fluff
- Requirements Activities. They are:
  - Identified
  - Captured
  - managed
  - Communicated
  - prioritised
  - estimated
  - scoped
  - de-scoped
  - signed off
- Requirement Elicitation
  - Process of seeking, uncovering, acquiring & elaborating requirements for a PC based system
  - Requiements are elicited rather than just captured or collected, This implies there are discovery, Emergence & development elements to the elicitation process
  - Complex process involving many activities with a variety of availiable techniques, approaches & tools
  - Stakeholder Analysis
- Requirement Elicitation Techniques
  - Brain Storming
  - Interviews
  - Requirement Workshops
  - Doccument Analysis
  - Observation
  - Prototyping
  - Survey questionairs

#### Requirement Process Stages:

- Specification:
  - After analysing & modeling the requirements, they are specified & documented in a software requirement specification doc
- Verification & Validation:
  - checking doc requirements & models are consistent & meet stakeholder needs.
- Management:
  - Process of documenting, analyzing, tracing, prioritizing & agreeing on requirements then controlling change & communication to relevent stakeholders
  - continuous process
  - ensure organization documents, verifies & meet expectation/needs of customers and stakeholders.
  - Tools:
    - Requirement Backlog
    - Requirements Register or Spreadsheets
    - IBM Jazzhub
    - JIRA

#### Stakeholders

- Stakeholders:
  - Individuals, or organisations who are interested or could influence the devlopment of the requirements and software system projects
  - Could have different roles based on their interest & responsibility of the organisation
  - Failure to discover all stakeholders
- Stakeholder classes:
  - **Sponsor**: Owner representative, Pays for the development of the product.
  - **Owner**
  - **ProjectManager**
  - **Business Analyst**
  - **Quantity Analyst**
  - **Customer**
  - **Supplier**
  - **End-User**: Consumer, buys the product, hands on operator of the product
  - **Domain Subject Matter Expert (SME)**
  - **Implementation Subject Matter Expert (SME)**
  - **Support Proff**
  - **Regulator**
