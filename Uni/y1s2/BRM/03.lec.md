# Requirement Elicitication

## Oveview

### Objectives

- Plan & carryout Elicitaion of requirements from sources such as stakeholdes
- Understand the benefits & drawback of different elicitaion techniques
- Identify appropriate techniques for eliciting requirements for a give system & situation
- Understand the differences btween requirements elicitation for existing system v new systems `maybe quiz`

## Topics

- Requirement Elicitation process
- Techniques for eliciting requirements
  - Interview
  - Questionnairs/ Survey
  - Observation
  - Prototyping
  - Requirements Workshop

## Requirements Elicitation Process

- These activities could be included in any requirements elicitation process
  - Understanding the application domain & properties of the existing system
  - Identifying the sources of requirements
  - Identifying & Analyzing all relevent stakeholders
  - Selecting the approaches, Techniques & tools for elicitation
  - Eliciting the requirements form different sources using the selected techniques, apporaches & tools

### Present v Future System

Many aspects of the current system will be carried into the new system. The need to develop a new IS system is usually problems & inadequacies of the current system. Its important to capture both information abou the current system & requirements (what cannot be achieve with the current system).

so its key to:
- get understanding of
  - Overal **objective** of current enterprise
  - what do individuals users of the system **want to achieve**
- Understand
  - How the business is operating at present
  - how many people are working right now & what they **Cant** do with the existing system
  - Problems & inadequacies of the current system
- These are key for `new requirements`

### Investigating current systems

- is the current a manual one, based on documents, forms & files?
- is it computersed? or legacy system
- is it a combination of manual & computerised
- if its evolved over the year, which sections are usable & what does not meet user's needs?
- These questions can lead to defining the boundary of the new sustems & its interface with to the existing system

## Requirements Elicitaiton Techniques

### Interview

- a **systematic approach** designed to elicit information from a person/group of people. Can be both informal/formal talking to an interviewee asking relevant questions & documenting responses
- Need good direct questions in order to obtain answes that will e used to create formal requirements
  - **One on One** interviews are most common.
  - **Group interview**: interviewer must be careful to elicit responses from ALL attendees
- Most widely used elicitation & fact finding techniques, requires the most skill & sensitivity
- Requires good **planning**, good **interpersonal skills** & an alert,responsive frame of mind
- Key factor of intervire is to ensure that biases and predisposition of the interviewe dont interfere with a free exchange of information.
- Used to explore issues & can collect some quantitative but mostly qualitative data
- **2 Types** of interviews
  - **Structured**:  interviewe has pre-defined set of questions
  - **Untructured**: with out pre-defined questions, discuss topics of interest in an open ended way.

#### Steps of intervire
  1. determine stakeholders to interview
  2. establish the objective
  3. Decelop questions, topics
  4. prepare
  5. conduct
  6. document
  7. evaluate

#### Checklist for interviews
  
- **Before**
  - establish objective
  - identify relevent users, stakeholders
  - determine project team menber to participate
  - list of **questions**, issues for **discussion**
  - **review** related docs & materials
  - set time & location
  - inform participants of details
- **During**:
  - stick to timeble, do not overun
  - take notes, ask for permission for recording
  - **probe** for details using questions
  - identify & documents unanswered items or open questions
- **After the interview**
  - **Thanks the interviewee**, offer to provide a copy of the notres, make a**ppointments for more interview if needed**
  - **Review & transcribe** tapes/notes ASAP while the content is still fresh in your mind
  - **review** notes for accuracy, completeness, consistency & understanding
  - Transfer information to appropriate modes & docs
  - Identify area needing further clarification
  - send interviewees youre notes & upgrade the notes to reflect their coment

#### Interview **Guidelines**

- plan, organise, be specific aboyt questions
- start with general highlevel quetions
- take & share notes, keep it 1-2 hrs
- record 7 follow up action items
- focus on the project
- Ask, Listen,Probe, Understand & record (ALPUR)
- avoid being bias, blaming, jargons
- **The Donts**
  - dont show agression or create impression of apporting blame
  - dont force solutions on users, play the role of an advisor & faclitator
  - explain limitations in user terms
  - descrive how the system will help users in their work
  - dont ask leading questions, ask for suggestion & improvements & follow them up
  
#### Questions type

- **open Questions**
  - Encourace spontaneous & unstructures responses
  - general questions establishing a viewpoint, requires a **full/descriptive** answer
  - Why, how, what, descrive, what do you think about, tell me about
  - Explanation of a process
    - Is there anything i should be asking you?
- **Closed Question**
  - answerd by a short phrase, yes/no
  - used to obtain specific fact, specific information
  - try to limit/ restrict response by asking for a specific answer
- **Probe**: follow up from a specific answer
  - Why
  - Can you elaborate 
- Most interviews are a combination of all 3 question types
  
#### Pros/Cons

- **Pros**:
  - let you have **full discussions & explanations** of questions & answers
  - let you better adapt to what users say
  - Analyst can **probe in greather depth** than any other methods of elicitation
  - allow interviewees to express opinions in private
- **Cons**
  - time consuming, costly
  - require commitment & involvement of participants
  - result transcrition & analysis can be complex & expensive
  - subhjected to bias(your own bias)
  - conflicting info can be given, and that can be difficult to resolve
  - risk of unintenionally leading the interviewee

### Questionairs/Surveys

- Cocument containing a number of **standard questions** that can be sent to individuals to obtain info from a **large number** of people/ whhen the people are geographically dispersed
- can collect both quantitative/qualitative data
- can also appropriate for sustems that will be used by the public & where the analyst has to investigate all types of users for the system
- **Types of questions**
  - yes/no
  - multiple choice questions
  - scaled question 1-5
  - open ended question: pharases long form answr
- **Advantages** `quiz`
  - Economical & quick method of gathering data forom a **large sample**
  - specific questions, can be administered **remotely**
  - depends on the design, result can be analysed with software
- **Disadvantages** `quiz`
  - hard to design effective questinairs
  - usually not answered completely
  - low response rate are often too low for stat significance
  - no way to **follow up**

### Observation
  
- the analyst **Observe** the execution of **existing processes** by users without direct interference.
- gives additional perspective & a better understanding of system functionalities, as observed as it actually behaves
- observation also **`verify` statements** made **in the interview & surveys** to determine whether the procedures within the domain operates as descrived
- might **discover** system **documentation & interview statements** are/**not accurate**
- **Direct gathering **rather than through description
- individual behaviour maybe altered because they are being observed
- avoid disturbing users from normal activities
- Appropriate situations for observation
  - essential for quantitatie & mostly qualitative data about peoples jobs
  - can verify/ disprove assertions from stakeholders
  - useful for situations where different interviewees have provide conflicting info about the existing syst
- Guidelines
  - ask enough questions to ensure you have a complete understanding of the present system
  - docs any procedures for handling expetions
  - consider the users who wotk with the system
- pros
  - first hand experince of the current system
  - realtime data, high level of calidity
  - can be use to verify info form other sources
- Disadvantages
  - **time consuming**, lots of data
  - can disrupt people
  - required trained & skilled ibserver to be most effective
  - ethical proplems in sensitive data
  - logistical problems if staff is observed work shifts
  - unusual exeptrion & critical situation may not occur duing observation

### Prototyping
  - this is an initial working model of a more complex entity, usually a program with limited functionality that is built to test out some aspect of how the final system functions
  - Prototypes are constructed with these objectives:
    - investigate user requirement
    - test specific concept or verify an approach
    - focus on human-computer interface(IO, UX/UI)
  - Storyboard (UI FLOW)
    - Storyboard: series of drawing used for identifying UI
    - UI flow diagrams offere a high-lvl view of a system, can quickly gain an undersanding how the system is expected wot work, puts you in a position where you can validate the flow of your aplication UI
    - can use to model interactions users have with the software as defined in a seccond usecase
    - enable a high lvl overview of the users interface for the app
  - Advantages
    - Allow early user interaction/feedback
    - can be a cheap way to uncover & confirm a variety of requiremetns
    - support users who are more comfortable at articulating their needs using images
    - Provide a vehicle for designers/developers to learn about the UI needs and to evolve system requiremtns
  - Cons
    - depends on the complexity, prototyping to elicit requirements can take considerable time
    - may lead users to develop unrealistic expectations, disregard of the systems performance, completion date, reliability
- Requirements Workshop
  - used to expedite requirement elicitation. **joint application dev** or **Focus group**
  - objective is to compress all activities involved in other fact finding techiniques into a shorter series of workshop sessions with users & project team members
  - often conducted in special rooms with supporting facilities: projectors, whiteboard, flip charts
  - used to scope, discover, define, refine, update, prioritize & reach closure on requirements of the target system
  - used to generate ideas for newfeatures or product, reach concensus on conflicting views, or review requirements
  - organised process: brain storming, topdown analysis
  - Documented Approach: Output is documented in a way to make it easy to read/understand/agree upon
  - Guidelines:
    - carefully selected participatnts to correctly represent different class of stakeholders
    - ensure all participating stakeholders have their input heard
    - must have a Skilled facilitator
    - Remain neutral & promote discussion
    - meeting room should have all the necessary facilities 7 the environment be conductive to hold effective meetings
    - Visual aids
  - Pros
    - effective in reducing project development effors & shorteneing the schedule
    - used to generate ideas for features/ products
    - reach concensus on conflictig views
    - is able to gague reaction to stimulis materials
    - provide means for stakeholders to collaborate, make decisions & gain a mutual understanding of requirements
  - Cons
    - Speeding up the decisions is risky, unoptimal decisions
    - details can be inappropriately defined/missed altogether
