## Oveview

### Objectives

- Plan & carryout Elicitaion of requirements from sources such as stakeholdes
- Understand the benefits & drawback of different elicitaion techniques
- Identify appropriate techniques for eliciting requirements for a give system & situation
- Understand the differences btween requirements elicitation for existing system v new systems

## Topics

- Requirement Elicitation process
- Techniques for eliciting requirements
  - Interview
  - Questionnairs/ Survey
  - Observation
  - Prototyping
  - Requirements Workshop

## Requirements Elicitation Process

- These activities could be included in any requirements elicitation process
  - Understanding the application domain & properties of the existing system
  - Identifying the sources of requirements
  - Identifying & Analyzing all relevent stakeholders
  - Selecting the approaches, Techniques & tools for elicitation
  - Eliciting the requirements form different sources using the selected techniques, apporaches & tools

### Present v Future System

Many aspects of the current system will be carried into the new system. The need to develop a new IS system is usually problems & inadequacies of the current system. Its important to capture both information abou the current system & requirements (what cannot be achieve with the current system).

so its key to:
- get understanding of
  - Overal objective of current enterprise
  - what do individuals users of the system what to achieve
- Understand
  - How the business is operating at present
  - how many people are working right now & what can they not do with the existing system
  - Problems & inadequacies of the current system
- These are key for `new requirements`

### Investigating current systems

- is the current a manual one, based on documents, forms & files?
- is it computersed? or legacy system
- is it a combination of manual & computerised
- if its evolved over the year, which sections are usable & what does not meet user's needs?
- These questions can lead to defining the boundary of the new sustems & its interface with to the existing system

## Requirements Elicitaiton Techniques

- Interview
  - a systematic approach designed to elicit infor from a person/group of people. Can be both informal/formal talking to an interviewee asking relevant questions & documenting responses
  - Need good direct questions in order to obtain answes that will e used to create formal requirements
  - One-One interviews are most common.
  - Group interview: interviewer must be careful to elicit responses from ALL attendees
  - Most widely used elicitation & fact finding techniques, requires the most skill & sensitivity
  - Requires good planning, good interpersonal skills & an alert&responsive frame of mind
  - Key factor of intervire is to ensure that biases and predisposition of the interviewe dont interfere with a free exchange of information.
  - Used to explore issues & can collect some quantitative but mostly qualitative data
  - **2 Types** of interviews
    - **Structured**:  interviewe has pre-defined set of questions
    - **Untructured**: with out pre-defined questions, discuss topics of interest in an open ended way.
  - Steps of intervire
    1. determine stakeholders to interview
    2. establish the objective
    3. Decelop questions, topics
    4. prepare
    5. conduct
    6. document
    7. evaluate
  - Checklist for interviews
    - Before
      - establish objective
      - relevent users, stakeholders
      - determine project team menber to participate
      - list of questions, issues for discussion
      - review related docs & materials
      - set time & location
      - inform participants of details
    - During:
      - stick to timeble, do not overun
      - take notes, ask for permission for recording
      - probe for details using questions
      - identify & documents unanswered items or open questions
    - After the intervire
      - Thanks the interviewee, offer to provide a copy of the notres, make appointments for more interview if needed
      - Review & trnascrive tapes/notes ASAP while the content is still fresh in your mind
      - review notes for accuracy, completeness, consistency & understanding
      - Transfer information to appropriate modes & docs
      - Identify area needing further clarification
      - send interviewees youre notes & upgrade the notes to reflect their coment
  - Guidelines
    - plan, organise, be specific aboyt questions
    - start with general highlevel quetions
    - take & share notes, keep it 1-2 hrs
    - record 7 follow up action items
    - focus on the project
    - Ask, Listen,Probe, Understand & record (ALPUR)
    - avoid being bias, blaming, jargons
  - The Donts
    - dont show agression or create impression of apporting blame
    - dont force solutions on users, play the role of an advisor & faclitator
    - explain limitations in user terms
    - descrive how the system will help users in their work
    - dont ask leading questions, ask for suggestion & improvements & follow them up
  - Questions type
    - open Questions
      - Encourace spontaneous & unstructures responses
      - general questions establishing a viewpoint, requires a full answer
      - Why, how, what, descrive, what do you think about, tell me about
    - Closed Question
      - answerd by a short phrase, yes/no
      - used to obtain specific fact, specific information
      - try to limit/ restrict response by asking for a specific answer
    - Probe: follow up from a specific answer
  - Most interviews are a combination of all 3 question types
  - Pros: 
    - let you have full discussions & explanations of questions & answers
    - let you better adapt to what users say
    - Analyst can probe in greather depth than any other methods of elicitation
    - allow interviewees to express opinions in private
  - Cons
    - time consuming, costly
    - require commitment & involvement of participants
    - result transcrition & analysis can be complex & expensive
    - subhjected to bias
    - conflicting info can be given, and that can be difficult to resolve
    - risk of unintenionally leading the interviewee
- Questionairs/Surveys;
  - Cocument containing a number of standard questions that can be sent to individuals to obtain info from a large number of people/ whhen the people are geographically dispersed
  - can collect both quantitative/qualitative data
  - can also appropriate for sustems that will be used by the public & where the analyst has to investigate all types of users for the system
  - Types of questions
    - yes/no
    - multiple choice questions
    - scaled question 1-5
    - open ended question: pharases long form answr
  - Advantages
    - Economical & quick method of gathering data forom a large sample
    - specific questions, can be administered remotely
    - depends on the design, result can be analysed with software
  - Disadvantages
    - hard to design effective questinairs
    - usually not answered completely
    - low response rate are often too low for stat significance
    - no way to follow up
- Observation
  - the analyst Observe the execution of existing processes by users without direct interference.
  - gives additional perspective 7 a better understanding of system functionalities, as observed as it actually behaves
  - observation also verify statements made in the interview & surveys to determine whether the procedures within the domain operates as descrived
  - might discover system documentation & interview statements are/not accurate
  - Direct gathering rather than through description
  - individual behaviour maybe altered because they are being observed
  - avoid disturbing users from normal activities
  - Appropriate situations for observation
    - essential for quantitatie & mostly qualitative data about peoples jobs
    - can verify/ disprove assertions from stakeholders
    - useful for situations where different interviewees have provide conflicting info about the existing syst
  - Guidelines
    - ask enough questions to ensure you have a complete understanding of the present system
    - docs any procedures for handling expetions
    - consider the users who wotk with the system
  - pros
    - first hand experince of the current system
    - realtime data, high level of calidity
    - can be use to verify info form other sources
  - Disadvantages 
    - time consuming, lots of data
    - can disrupt people
    - required trained & skilled ibserver to be most effective
    - ethical proplems in sensitive data
    - logistical problems if staff is observed work shifts
    - unusual exeptrion & critical situation may not occur duing observation
- Prototyping
  - this is an initial working model of a more complex entity, usually a program with limited functionality that is built to test out some aspect of how the final system functions
  - Prototypes are constructed with these objectives:
    - investigate user requirement
    - test specific concept or verify an approach
    - focus on human-computer interface(IO, UX/UI)
  - Storyboard (UI FLOW)
    - 
- Requirements Workshop
