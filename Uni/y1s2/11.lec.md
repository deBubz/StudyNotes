MAC address
IP address  Postal address
MAC address  Delivery specific address
Airport Codes, Shipping port ID, …
Used to identify destinations in a delivery link/LAN
MAC address
Identify a destination link NIC in one LAN, burned in to NIC ROM.
ID of the NIC - portable.
48 bit (six byte) MAC address, e.g. 1A-3F-B5-76-09-AD


LAN addresses and ARP
LAN addresses (more)
MAC address allocation administered by IEEE
manufacturer buys portion of MAC address space (to assure uniqueness), 
cisco: 00-18-89-, A8-9D-21-, …, 
Intel: 00-13-E8-, A0-88-69-, …
Compare to IP address - analogy:
MAC address: Your name/ID
IP address: like your address
 MAC flat address  ➜ portability 
can move LAN card from one LAN to another
IP hierarchical address not portable
 address depends on IP subnet to which node is attached

ARP: address resolution protocol
ARP table: each IP node (host, router) on LAN has table
IP/MAC address mappings for some LAN nodes:
          < IP address; MAC address; TTL>
TTL (Time To Live): time after which address mapping will be forgotten (typically 20 min)
ARP protocol: same LAN
Host A wants to send datagram to host B
Host B’s MAC address not in host A’s ARP table.
If host B is in the same subnet/LAN as host A, then
Host A broadcasts ARP query packet, containing B's IP address 
destination MAC address 
= FF-FF-FF-FF-FF-FF
all nodes in subnet/LAN receive ARP query 
Host B receives ARP packet, replies to A with its (B's) MAC address
frame sent to A’s MAC address (unicast)
Then host A can send datagrams to B with host B’s MAC address (unicast)

Addressing: routing to another LAN
walkthrough: send datagram from A to B via R
focus on addressing – at IP (datagram) and MAC layer (frame)
assume A knows B’s IP address (how? e.g. B is a web server)
assume A knows IP address of first hop router, R (how?)
assume A knows R’s MAC address (how?)

Ethernet

VLANS
Ethernet
“dominant” wired LAN technology: 
single chip, multiple speeds (e.g., Broadcom  BCM5761)
first widely used LAN technology
simpler, cheap
kept up with speed race: 10 Mbps – 10 Gbps 

Ethernet: physical topology
bus: popular through mid 90s
all nodes in same collision domain (can collide with each other)
star: prevails today
active switch in center
each “spoke” runs a (separate) Ethernet protocol (nodes do not collide with each other)
Ethernet frame structure
sending adapter encapsulates IP datagram (or other network layer protocol packet) in Ethernet frame



preamble: 
7 bytes with pattern 10101010 followed by one byte with pattern 10101011
 used to synchronize receiver, sender clock rates
Ethernet frame structure (more)
addresses: 6 byte source, destination MAC addresses
if adapter receives frame with matching destination address, or with broadcast address (e.g. ARP packet), it passes data in frame to network layer protocol
otherwise, adapter discards frame
type: indicates higher layer protocol (mostly IP but others possible, e.g., Novell IPX, AppleTalk)
CRC: cyclic redundancy check at receiver
error detected: frame is dropped
Ethernet: unreliable, connectionless
connectionless: no handshaking between sending and receiving NICs 
unreliable (but has error detection with CRC): receiving NIC doesn't send acks or nacks to sending NIC
data in dropped frames recovered only if initial sender uses higher layer rdt (e.g., TCP), otherwise dropped data lost
Ethernet’s MAC protocol: CSMA/CD with binary backoff (no longer)
802.3 Ethernet standards: link & physical layers
many different Ethernet standards
common MAC protocol and frame format
different speeds: 2 Mbps, 10 Mbps, 100 Mbps, 1Gbps, 10 Gbps, 40 Gbps, 100Gbps
different physical layer media: fiber, cable

switches
VLANS
Ethernet switch
link-layer device: takes an active role
store, forward Ethernet frames
examine incoming frame’s MAC address, selectively forward  frame to one-or-more outgoing links when frame is to be forwarded on segment
transparent
hosts are unaware of presence of switches
plug-and-play, self-learning
switches do not need to be configured

Switch: multiple simultaneous transmissions
hosts have dedicated, direct connection to switch
switches buffer packets
Ethernet protocol used on each incoming link, but no collisions; full duplex
each link is its own collision domain
switching: A-to-A’ and B-to-B’ can transmit simultaneously, without collisions 
Switch forwarding table
Q: how does switch know A’ reachable via interface 4, B’ reachable via interface 5?
Switch: self-learning
switch learns which hosts can be reached through which interfaces
when frame received, switch “learns”  location of sender: incoming LAN segment
records sender/location pair in switch table
Switch: frame filtering/forwarding
when  frame received at switch:

1. record incoming link, MAC address of sending host
2. index switch table using MAC destination address
3. if entry found for destination
  then forward frame on interface indicated by entry
		else flood  /* forward on all interfaces except arriving
                          interface */
  
Self-learning, forwarding: example
frame destination, A’, location unknown:
Interconnecting switches
self-learning switches can be connected together:
Self-learning multi-switch example
Suppose C sends frame to I, I responds to C
Institutional network
Switches vs. routers
both are store-and-forward: 
routers: network-layer devices (examine network-layer headers)
switches: link-layer devices (examine link-layer headers)

both have forwarding tables:
routers: compute tables using routing algorithms, IP addresses
switches: learn forwarding table using flooding, learning, MAC addresses

Synthesis: a day in the life of a web request
journey down protocol stack complete!
application, 
transport, 
network, 
link
putting-it-all-together: synthesis!
goal: identify, review, understand protocols (at all layers) involved in seemingly simple scenario: requesting www page
scenario: student attaches laptop to campus network, requests/receives www.google.com 


A day in the life: scenario
A day in the life… connecting to the Internet
connecting laptop needs to get its own IP address, addr of first-hop router, addr of DNS server: use DHCP
A day in the life… connecting to the Internet
DHCP server formulates DHCP ACK containing 
client’s IP address, 
IP address of first-hop router for client, 
name & IP address of DNS server

A day in the life… ARP (before DNS, before HTTP)
before sending HTTP request, need IP address of www.google.com:  DNS
A day in the life… using DNS
A day in the life…TCP connection carrying HTTP
A day in the life… HTTP request/reply
