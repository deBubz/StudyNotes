## Components of Relational Model

- **Data Structure**: Tables(relations), rows, columns
- **Data Manipulation**: powerful SQL operations for retrieving & modifying data
- **Data Integrity**: Mechanism for implementing BR that maintain integrity of manipulated data

b## Relations

- relation is a named, 2d table of data
- table consist of rows(records) and columns (attribute/fields)
- requirements for tables to qualify as a relation
  - Unique name
  - all attributes must be **atomic**(not multivalued/composite)
  - every row must be unique(cannot have 2 rows with the same values for all field)
  - Attributes must have unique names
  - order of columns/rows is irrelevant

### 2.1 Correspondence with ER model

- Relation correspond with entity types & with m:m relationship types
- Rows == entity instances with m:m relationsip instances
- Columns == attributes

**NOTE** relaion(in relational db) != relationship (ER model)

### Key Fields

- keys are special fields that have 2 main purpose
  - PK: unique ID of the Relaion
  - FK: are ID that enable a dependent relation (the many side) to refer to its parent relation (the 1 side)
- Keys can be simple or composite
- Keys usually are used as indexes to speedup response to user queries (ch5)

#### Activity 4.1

Explain why when there is 1:m relationshp btween 2 entities, PK of the entity on one 1-side will be FK on the m-side. Provide example.

category 1:m books

| CategoryId | CategoryName | CategoryTotal|
|---|---|---|
| c001 | Adventure | 6 |
| c002 | Thriller | 0 |
| c003 | Romance | 6 |

|BookId| BookName| BookQuant | CategoryID|
|---|---|---|---|
|b0001| Journey To the center of the earth | 4 | c001|
|b002 | 20000 leagues under the seas |2| c001|
|b003 | Spring Snow | 6 | c003|

This is because it is not possible to use the PK of m-side as a FK in the 1-side as it would cause data repetition

**NOTE** For the schema, similar to conceptual ERD, identifiersPK (both composite and simple) are underlined with a solid line. FK are underlined with a dotted line

Also it is important to draw out the schema and review the path to

- understand the relations
- have abstract information aout converting ERD to Relations
- know of the constrains while converting ERD into Schema

### 2.3 Integrity constraints

**Integrity coonstraints** are applied to facilitate maintaining the accuracy & integrity of data in the DB. These are the major types of Integrity constraints

- Domain constraints: allowable values for an attribute(datatype, char limit)
- Entity Integrity: no PK may be null
- Referential Integrity: any FK value (on m-side) must match a PK value in the relation of the 1-side. **Referential Integrity** rule is used to maintain consistency among rows btween 2 tables.

#### 2.3.3 Referential Integrity

- FK must match a PK of a related relation

> - Delete Rule:
>   - Restrict: disallow delete of "parent" side if related row exist in "dependent" side
>   - Cascade: automaticl deletes "dependent" side rows that correspond with the "parent" side row to be deleted
>   - Set to Null: set the FK in the "dependent" side to null if deleting from the parent side. FK can be null, Set-to-null not allowed for weak/associated entities

**NOTE** slide 29 @ week 7

## 3. Transforming ERD into Relations (Conceptual into Logic)

### 3.1 Mapping Regular Entities into Relation

- Simple Attributes: E-R attributes map directly onto relation
- CompositeAttributes: use only the simple component attributs
- Multivalued Attribute: became a sepereate relaion with a FK taken from the superior entity.

#### Activity 4.2

Redesign Entity, justify design

> every employee need to have at lease 1 skill & every skill can be chosen by any employee. The info about skills like SkillID & name is stored inthe DB

3 Entity: Employee, Skill, EmployeeSkill(associated)

- Employee: EmployeeID, EmployeeName, EmployeeRole
- EmployeeSkill: EmployeeID, SkillID, ExperienceLevel
- Skill: SkillID, SkillName, SkillType

This needs to be redesigned into 2 Strong Ent and 1 Associated Entity because as the Business Rule states `employee need to have atleast 1 skill & every skill can be chosen by any employee` meaning 1 employee could have more than 1 skill. The relation the 2 entity is Skill Opt m:m Mandatory Employee.

#### Activity 4.3

Convert ERD into relation

- Customer: CustomerID, CustomerName
- Shipment: ShipmentID, ShipmentDate, ShipmentAmount, CustomerID, VendorID
- Vendor: VendorID, VendorAddress

```sql
CUSTOMER(CustomerID, CustomerName)
VENDOR(VendorID, VendorAddress)

SHIPMENT(ShipmentID, ShipmentDate, ShipmentAmount, CustomerID*, VendorID*) 
FK (CustomerID) references CUSTOMER 
FK (VendorID) references VENDOR
```

### 3.2 Mapping Weak Entities

- Becomes seperate relation with FK taken from the superior entity
- PK composed of
  - Partial identifier of weak entity
  - PK of idntifying relation(Strong entity)
e The FK in a weak entity should not be null

### 3.3 Mapping Binary Relationship

- 1:m - PK on the 1-side becomes FK on m-side
- m:m - create new relation(associated entity) with the pk of the two entities as its PK (composite PK - FK of both entities)
- 1:1 - PK on mandatory side becomes a fk on Optional side

### 3.4 Mapping Associative Entities

- ID not assigned: default PK for te associtation relation is composed of the PK of 2 entities (m:m)
- ID assigned: natural & familiar to endusers, default id maynot be unique

### 3.5 Mapping Unary Relationships

- 1:m recursive FK in the same relation
- m:m One for the enity type, one for an associative relation in which the PK has 2 attr, both taken from the PK of the entity

Slide 56 - 59

### 3.6 Mapping Ternary (and n-ary) Relationships

- One relation for each Entity one for the associaative entity
- Associative entity has fk to each entity in the relationship
- Sometime it can be better to create an ID for the associative entity

### 3.7 Mapping Super/Subtype Relationship

- one relation for supertype and for each subtype
- Supertype attr (including id and discriminator) go into supertype relation
- 1:1 relationship establish btween super & each subtype, with supertype as the primary table
