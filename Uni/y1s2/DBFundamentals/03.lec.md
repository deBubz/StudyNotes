## 1. Supertype/ Subtype Relationships

Supertype & subtype is used to

- Enhance ER model extending the original ER model with new modeling constructs through:
  - Subtype: subgrouping of entities in a ET that has attributes disctinct from other subgroupings.
  - Supertype: generic ET that has a relationship with 1 or more subtypes, containing the common attributes between subtypes
  - Attribute inheritance: 
    - Subtype entities inherit balues of all attributes of the supertype
    - An instance of a subtype os also an instance of the supertype
  - Subtype & its Supertypes have the same Entity type
- PK of Supertype is FK in each subtype. This FK is the PK of the subtypes
- **Attribute Inheritance**:
  - Sub entities inherit values of all attribute of the supertype
  - An instance of a subtype is also an insance of the supertype

### Discussion 1

- Example of Supertype & Subtypes
- Definition
  - Subtype entities Inherit values of all attribute of the supertype
  - An instance of a subtype is also an instance of the supertype
  - Supertype and its Subtype have the same Entity Type
- Why we need to construct Supertype & Subtype
  - Prevent the issue of blank data
  - Better data organising

#### Possible questions

- `Inheritance chain, can a subtype be a supertype of another entity type?`

### Activitt 3.1

1. Which of the following apply to both OUTPATIENTs & RESIDENT_PATIENTs

- Checkback_D
- Date_Discharged
- Bed_ID
- `None`

These apply Patient_ID, Patient_Name, Admit_Date

## 2. Relationships & Subtypes

- Relationship at the Supertype lvl indicate that all subtype with participate in the relationship. (its subtypes are involved in any relationship the supertype has)
- Instances of a subtype may participate in a relationship unique to that subtype (relationship of a subtype is unique to itself)

### Notation

- EER see slide 24
- MS Visio Notation see slide 25 (dont use visio for assessment)

## 3. Generalization & Specialization

- Generalization: defining a more general entity type from a set of more specialized entity type. BOTTOM-UP (making a supertype?)
  - `e.g` look at different entity types to see any similarities, group up to form a supertype
- Specialization: defining 1 or more subtypes of the supertype & forming super/subtypes relationship TOP-DOWN
  - `e.g` Looking at an entity if there are any attributes that only applies for certain data, split it up intu subtypes

### Activity 3.2

2. property by which subtype entities possess the values of all attributes of a supertype is called

- heirachy reception
- Class management
- `attrbute inheritance`
- generalization

### Activity 3.3

Create the SUPPLIES table

||Supplies||
|---|---|---|
| PartNo | SupplierID | UnitPrice|
| 1x | s1001 | 12 |
| 1x | s2345 | 13 |
| 2z | s1001 | 25 |
| 3y | s4444 | 7 |

## 4. Constraints in Supertype/Subtype Relationships

Constraints in relationship inclides

### 4.1 Completeness Constraints(Total/Partical Specialization)

  The Completeness Constrains is whether an instance of a supertype must also be a member of atleast 1 subtype(super must have 1 sub)

- Total Specialization Rule:
  - Yes(DoubleLine), all possible subtypes are included.
  - `e.g` a supertype entity instance must be a subtype instance.
- Partial Specilization:
  - No (single line), There are more subtypes that have not been included.
  - `e.g` a supertype instance can be a subtype instance, but it does not have to be a subtype instance.

### 4.2 Disjointed constraints (Disjoint/Overlapping sub-types)

Disjointed constraints is whether an instance of a supertype may simultaniously a member 2 or more subtypes.

- Disjoint Rule
  - an supertype instance can only be 1 of the subtypes
- Overlap Rule
  - an supertype instance could be more than 1 of the subtypes

**NOTE**: watch the notation

### 4.3 Subtype Discriminator

Subtype Discriminator is an attribute of the sypertype whose values determine the target subtype

- **Disjoint**: a simple attribute with alternative values to indicate the possible subtype
  - Employee supertype with Empl_Type to determine which subtype the employee belongs in ('S'= salaried, 'H'= Hourly)
- **Overlapping**: **composite attributes** whose subparts pertain to different subtypes. Each subpart contains a Bool value to indicate whether or not the instance belings to the associate subtype

## Summary

- Understand use of supertype/subtype relationships
- Understand use of specialization & generalization
- Specify completeness & disjointed constrains
- Develop supertype/subtype heirachies for realistic business situations
