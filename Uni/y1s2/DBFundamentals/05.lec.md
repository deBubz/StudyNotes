## Why we need to do **Normalization**

- Now you have ERD & Relations
- Questions
  - Are your relations well-structured?
  - Will you have any redundant data in your relations?
  - Will you have any Data inconsistency in your Db?

E.G 1 - Emplyee

> Something

- Q1 relation? Yes, unique roes & no multivalued attributes
- Q2 PK? Comp: EmpID, CourseTitle (why)
- Is the relation well structured? Lets look at the anomalies
  - Insertion Anomaly: cant enter new employee without having emp take CLASS. `why`
  - Deletion Anomaly: If we rm employee 140. We loose info about the existence of a Tax Acc class
  - Modification Anomaly: giving salary increase to employee 100 will force us to update many records

**NOTE**: anomalies hhappen after merging db that are desigend by other designers/ mergina tables from different db to create new table

> PoS tables.
>
> Need normalization to fix these anomalies

## Terms to know to do Normalization

## 1 Well-structure Relations And data Normalization

### 1.1 Functional Demendencies (FD)

- Functional Dependancy: constrain btween 2 attributes in which the value of one attripute(dependant) is determined by the value of another attribute(Determinant)
  - Value of one attribute/ combinations of attributes (X) determine the value of another attribute (Y)
  - X -> Y
  - X determinant, Y dependant
  - EmpID -> Name, Salary

### 1.2 Keys: Super-key, Candidate Key & Functional Dependencies(FD)

Keys of a Relation

- **Super-Key**: a **set of attributes** in a table whose values can be used to uniquely ID a row in the relation
- **Candidate Key**: attribute, or **minimal set of attribute**, that uniquely identifues row in a relation
  - Each non-key field is functionally dependent on every candidate key
  - One of the candidate key will become the PK (credit card num & SS# in a table, both are candidate)
- **PK**: Unique Identifyer, Not NULL, one of the candidate keys will become the PK
- Names are not a good choice for PK

#### Activity 5.1

2 Properties must be satisfied by candidate keys:

- Unique Identification: minimal set of attributes that can be used to id records
- Non-redundancy

#### Activity 5.2

- Differnce btween Candidate Key and PK

| Candidate Key | Primary Key |
|---|---|
| Set of attribute | One Unique Attribute|
| There can be many sets of Candidate key| One candidate key will become PK |

### 1.3 Determining CandidateKey through Functional Dependencies

- Candidate keys of a relation R can be defined using given FunctionalDependancies set of the relation.
- To achieve this we can use these concepts
  - **1.3.1** Attribute Closure
    - FD set of Relation R, if A= attribute/combination of attribute, set of attribute in relation R rhar are functionally dependant on A is called **Attribute Closure of A** & it can be represented as A+ (slide25)
    - Steps to find **Attribute Closure of A**
      1. Add A to attrubute Closure set of A (A+)
      2. Recursively add attributes which can be functionally determined from attributes of the set A+ till done
  - **1.3.2** Algorithm to Determine Candidate Keys using FDs
    1. Colelc related FD to Relation R
    2. Create Table with 3 Column
    3. Write all attributes that only show up on the leftside of some FD in **Left** column
    4. Write all Attributes that shows up on the right of DF in **RIGHT**
    5. Write all attribute that shows in both left+right of FD in middle column
    6. Determine closure of attributes under Left/Middle to find which combination of theose attribute will **Functionally Determine** other attributes. Start from LEFT
       1. add attr to attribute closure set
       2. add attr which can be derived from any attribute of the attribute closure set
    7. Different combination of attributes under Left/Middle that **functionally determine** others attribute in R are Keys for R

Watch slide27

#### Activity 5.3

Determine PK of following relation

> Invoice (OrderID, ProductID, OrderDate, CustomerName, CustomerAddress, ProductDescription, ProductFinish, ProductStandardPrice, OrderQuanity)

Functional Dependancies

- OrderID,ProductID > OrderQuant
- ProductID > ProductDescription, ProductFinish, ProductStandardPrice
- OrderID > OrderDate, CustomerID> CustomerName, CustomerAddress
- CustomerID > CustomerName, CustomerAddress

PK: PrderID, ProductID, OrderID

**NOTE**

- Partial & Transitice FD in a relation cause the insertion, deletion & modification anomalies
  - Whats Partial FD?
  - Whats Transitive FD?
  - Why do they cause Anomalies?

### 1.4 Partial Functional Dependencies

- FD in which one or more non-key attr are functionally dependent on part(not all) of the PK (compositePK)

### 1.5 Transistive Functional Dependencies.

- Functional dependency btween the primart key and one or more non-key attributes that are dependent ont he primary keys via another non-key attributes. 

> FD btween a pk and non-pks

- slide 34

### 1.6 Why Partial & Transitive FunctionalDependencies causes the anomalies?

Look back at the anomalies

- Insertion, Deletion, Modification anomalies

These Anomalies exist due to multiple themes(Entity types) in one relation. This result in duplication and an uncessary dependency btween the entities

> General Rule: A table should not pertain to more than one entity type

## 2. Well Structured relation & Data Normalization

### 2.1 Well Structured Relations

- A relation that contains Minimal Data Redundancy & allows users to Insert, Delete, & Update rows without causing data inconsistencies
- Goals to avoid Anomalies
  - Insertion:
  - Deletion
  - Modification

### 2.2 Data Normalization

- Primmarity a tool to validate & improve a logical design so that it satisfies certain constraints that avoid unnecessary duplication of data
- The process of decomposing relation with anomalies to produce smaller, well-structured relations


## 3. Steps in Normalization

1. Table with multivalued attributes
   - Remove multivalued attributes
2. First normal form
   - Remove partial dependencies
3. Seccond normal form
   - remove transistive dependencies
4. Third normal form
   - Remove remaining anomalies resulting from multiple candidate keys
5. Boyce-Codd normal form
   - Remove multivalued dependencies
6. Fourth Normal Form
   - Remove remaining anomalies
7. Fifth normal form


> 3rd normal form is normally considered consistent

## 4. First Normal Form

1. No Derrived Attribute
   - Derrived attributes an be calvulated or derived using some business rule from other attribute.
   - remove derrived attribute from relation
2. Every Attribute Value is Atomic
   - Atomic attribute cant be divided into subparts
   - Split all non-atomic attributes
3. No multivalued Attributes
   - Multivalued attributes can havee more than one value at a time (array?)
   - Relation in first Normal Form (1NF) if
     - there are no repeating group in the relation
     - defined PK

> why is sl 45 repeated

## 5. Second Normal Form

- 1NF PLUS every non-key attribute is fully functionally dependent on the ENTIRE PK
- every non-key attribute must be defined by the entire key, not only part of the key
- no partial FD
- SOLUTION:
  1. Create new relation for each PK & move non-key attributes that are only dependent on this PK
  2. Consider this PK as a FK in the original table(relation)

> Slide46 - 49

## 6. Third Normal Form

- 2FN PLSU: no transitive dependencies (FD or non pk Attributes)
