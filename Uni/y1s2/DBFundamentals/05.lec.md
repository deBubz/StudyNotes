## Why we need to do **Normalization**

- Now you have ERD & Relations
- Questions
  - Are your relations well-structured?
  - Will you have any redundant data in your relations?
  - Will you have any Data inconsistency in your Db?

E.G 1 - Emplyee

> Something

- Q1 relation? Yes, unique roes & no multivalued attributes
- Q2 PK? Comp: EmpID, CourseTitle (why)
- Is the relation well structured? Lets look at the anomalies
  - Insertion Anomaly: cant enter new employee without having emp take CLASS. `why`
  - Deletion Anomaly: If we rm employee 140. We loose info about the existence of a Tax Acc class
  - Modification Anomaly: giving salary increase to employee 100 will force us to update many records

**NOTE**: anomalies hhappen after merging db that are desigend by other designers/ mergina tables from different db to create new table

> PoS tables.
>
> Need normalization to fix these anomalies

## Terms to know to do Normalization

## 1 Well-structure Relations And data Normalization

### 1.1 Functional Demendencies (FD)

- Functional Dependancy: constrain btween 2 attributes in which the value of one attripute(dependant) is determined by the value of another attribute(Determinant)
  - Value of one attribute/ combinations of attributes (X) determine the value of another attribute (Y)
  - X -> Y
  - X determinant, Y dependant
  - EmpID -> Name, Salary

### 1.2 Keys: Super-key, Candidate Key & Functional Dependencies(FD)

Keys of a Relation

- **Super-Key**: a **set of attributes** in a table whose values can be used to uniquely ID a row in the relation
- **Candidate Key**: attribute, or **minimal set of attribute**, that uniquely identifues row in a relation
  - Each non-key field is functionally dependent on every candidate key
  - One of the candidate key will become the PK (credit card num & SS# in a table, both are candidate)
- **PK**: Unique Identifyer, Not NULL, one of the candidate keys will become the PK
- Names are not a good choice for PK

#### Activity 5.1

2 Properties must be satisfied by candidate keys:

- Unique Identification: minimal set of attributes that can be used to id records
- Non-redundancy

#### Activity 5.2

- Differnce btween Candidate Key and PK

| Candidate Key | Primary Key |
|---|---|
| Set of attribute | One Unique Attribute|
| There can be many sets of Candidate key| One candidate key will become PK |

### 1.3 Determining CandidateKey through Functional Dependencies

- Candidate keys of a relation R can be defined using given FunctionalDependancies set of the relation.
- To achieve this we can use these concepts
  - **1.3.1** Attribute Closure
    - FD set of Relation R, if A= attribute/combination of attribute, set of attribute in relation R rhar are functionally dependant on A is called **Attribute Closure of A** & it can be represented as A+ (slide25)
    - Steps to find **Attribute Closure of A**
      1. Add A to attrubute Closure set of A (A+)
      2. Recursively add attributes which can be functionally determined from attributes of the set A+ till done
  - **1.3.2** Algorithm to Determine Candidate Keys using FDs
    1. Colelc related FD to Relation R
    2. Create Table with 3 Column
    3. Write all attributes that only show up on the leftside of some FD in **Left** column
    4. Write all Attributes that shows up on the right of DF in **RIGHT**
    5. Write all attribute that shows in both left+right of FD in middle column
    6. Determine closure of attributes under Left/Middle to find which combination of theose attribute will **Functionally Determine** other attributes. Start from LEFT
       1. add attr to attribute closure set
       2. add attr which can be derived from any attribute of the attribute closure set
    7. Different combination of attributes under Left/Middle that **functionally determine** others attribute in R are Keys for R

Watch slide27

#### Activity 5.3

Determine PK of following relation

> Invoice (OrderID, ProductID, OrderDate, CustomerName, CustomerAddress, ProductDescription, ProductFinish, ProductStandardPrice, OrderQuanity)

Functional Dependancies

- OrderID,ProductID > OrderQuant
- ProductID > ProductDescription, ProductFinish, ProductStandardPrice
- OrderID > OrderDate, CustomerID> CustomerName, CustomerAddress
- CustomerID > CustomerName, CustomerAddress

PK: PrderID, ProductID, OrderID

**NOTE**

- Partial & Transitice FD in a relation cause the insertion, deletion & modification anomalies
  - Whats Partial FD?
  - Whats Transitive FD?
  - Why do they cause Anomalies?

### 1.4 Partial Functional Dependencies

- FD in which one or more non-key attr are functionally dependent on part(not all) of the PK (compositePK)

### Why Partial & Transitive FunctionalDependencies causes the anomalies
