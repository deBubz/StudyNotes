## 1. Intro to Relational DB Management System

### 1.1 SQL Overview

- **S**tructured **Q**uery **L**anguage:  standard language for relational database management systems (RDBMS)
- **RDBMS**: A relational database management system that manages data as a collection of tables in which all relationships are represented by common values in related tables

### 1.2. Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS)

- Manges data as **collection of collection of tables** where all relationships are represented by common values in relatied tables(pk-fk)

### `1.6. SQL Environment`

- **Data Definition Language (DDL)** \*\*: Commands that define a database, CRUD functions and establishing constraints
- **Data Manipulation Language (DML)**: Commands that maintain and query a database

### 1.7. SQL Data Types

 `**Advice**`

- Load “Pine Valley Furniture” database (BigPVFC.txt) into PostgreSQL using the instructions in “Short Instruction-How to Start PostgeSQL”.
- To learn the SQL in this presentation, It is recommended that you type in and run all the queries given in  this presentation.
  - Just staring at the PowerPoint slides isn’t effective study
  - … but don’t just type them in – think about them!!!
  - Maybe even “play” with simple variations. (HD students should!)

## 2. Steps in Table Creation (based on the relations)

1. Identify attr **Data types**
2. Identify not null **Attr**
3. Identify unique columns (**Candidate Keys**)
4. ID **PK-FK** mates
5. Determine **Default Values**
6. ID constrains on columns (**Domain specs**)
7. Create the table and associated indexes

### 2.1 General syntax for CREATE TABLE statement used in DDL

```SQL
CREATE TABLE tblName
({columnDef [tlbConstraint]},.. [ON COMMIT {DELETE | PRESERVE} ROWS]);

where column definition ::=
column_name
    {domain_name | datatype[(size)]}
    [column_constraint_clause...]
    [default_val]
    [collate_clause]

and table constraint ::=
    [CONSTRAINT constraint_name]
    Constraint_type [constraint_attr]
```

### 2.2. The following slides create tables for this enterprise data model

in PDF pp11 - 15

**Relation**

- Customer(<u>CustID</u>, CustName, Street, City. State, PostalCode)
- Order(<u>OrderID</u>, OrderDate, CustID*)
  - FK (CustID) references Customer
- PRODUCT(ProdID, ProdDescription, ProdFinish, Price, ProdLineID)
- ORDERLINE(<u>OrderID*, ProdID*</u>, Quant)
  - FK (OrderID) references ORDER
  - FK (ProdID) references PRODUCT

```SQL
## CUSTOMER TABLE
CREATE TABLE Customer_T(
    CustID          NUMBER(11,0)    NOT NULL,
    CustName        VARCHAR2(25)    NOT NULL,
    CustStreet      VARCHAR2(30),
    CustCity        VARCHAR2(20),
    CustState       CHAR(2),
    CustPostalCode  VARCHAR2(9),
CONSTRAINT Customer_PK PRIMARY KEY (CustID));
```

```SQL
## ORDER TABLE
CREATE TABLE Order_T(
    OrderID         NUMBER(11,0)    NOT NULL,
    OrderDate       DATE DEFAULT SYSDATE,
    CustID          NUMBER(11,0),
CONSTRAINT Order_PK PRIMARY KEY (OrderID),
CONSTRAINT Order_FK FOREIGN KEY (CustID)
    REFERENCES Customer_T(CustID));
```

```SQL
## PRODUCT TABLE
CREATE TABLE Product_T(
    ProdID          NUMBER(11,0)    NOT NULL,
    ProdDescr       VARCHAR2(50),
    ProdFinish      VARCHAR2(20)
        CHECK (ProdFinish IN (
                'Cherry', 'Natural Ash', 'White Ash')),
    ProdPrice       DECIMAL(6,2),
    ProductLineID   INTERGER,
CONSTRAINT Product_PK PRIMARY KEY (ProductID));
```

```SQL
## ORDERLINE TABLE
CREATE TABLE OrderLine_T(
    OrderID         NUMBER(11,0)    NOT NULL,
    ProdID          NUMBER(11,0)    NOT NULL, #LEL
    OrderedQuan     NUMBER(11,0),
CONSTRAINT OrderLine_PK PRIMARY KEY (OrderID, ProdID),
CONSTRAINT OrderLine_FK1 FOREIGN KEY (OrderID)
    REFERENCES Order_T(OrderID),
CONSTRAINT OrderLine_FK2 FOREIGN KEY (ProdID)
    REFERENCES Product_T(ProdID));
```

## INFO FOR PART D

use CRUD 20-38 extended

### 2.3. Data Integrity Controls (Review from Lec4)

- **Referential integrity**: constraint that ensures that FK == PK values of a related table in 1:M relationships
- **Restricting**:
  - *Deletes* of primary records
  - *Updates* of primary records
  - *Inserts* of dependent records

**Note**:  see the “Integrity Constraints” in lecture 4 (Restrict, Cascade, and  Set-to-Null)

**Note**: Fig 6-7

## 3. Queries (DML)

### 3.1. SELECT Statement

Select statement is used for queries on single or multiple tables
Select column1, column2 From Table1 Where [Condition on rows] Group by column1, column2 Having [Condition on groups]     Order by column1
Clauses of the SELECT statement:
SELECT: List the columns (and expressions) to be returned from the query
FROM: Indicate the table(s) or view(s) from which data will be obtained
WHERE: Indicate the conditions under which a row will be included in the result
GROUP BY: Indicate categorization of results 
HAVING: Indicate the conditions under which a category (group) will be included
ORDER BY: Sorts the result according to specified criteria

### 3.1. SELECT Statement: Select & From Clauses

Clauses of the SELECT statement:
SELECT
List the columns (and expressions) to be returned from the query
FROM
Indicate the table(s) or view(s) from which data will be obtained
WHERE
Indicate the conditions under which a row will be included in the result
GROUP BY
Indicate categorization of results 
HAVING
Indicate the conditions under which a category (group) will be included
ORDER BY
Sorts the result according to specified criteria

#### 3.1.1.The Simplest Query

#### 3.1.2. Subset of columns

#### 3.1.3. Eliminating duplicate rows in result: Distinct

**Question**: Determine the types of Product finish in product table.

#### 3.1.4. Subset of rows: Question

Select productdescription, productfinish, productstandardprice from product_t;

How can we determine “product description”, “product finish” and “product standard price” just for products with “standard price” more than $275?

### 3.2. SELECT Statement: Where Clause

Clauses of the SELECT statement:
SELECT
List the columns (and expressions) to be returned from the query
FROM
Indicate the table(s) or view(s) from which data will be obtained
WHERE
Indicate the conditions under which a row will be included in the result
GROUP BY
Indicate categorization of results 
HAVING
Indicate the conditions under which a category (group) will be included
ORDER BY
Sorts the result according to specified criteria

#### 3.2.1. Subset of rows: Extract rows you want by using where

#### 3.2.2 SELECT Example Using Alias

Alias is an alternative column header name

#### 3.2.3. Comparison Operators Using in Where Clause

Find products with standard price less than $275

#### 3.2.4. Other Operators Use in Where Clause 

Operators that are used in where clause:
Between
And / Or
Like
is not null
In

##### 3.2.4.1. Between operator in where clause

**Question**: Determine “product description”, “product finish” and “product standard price” just for products with “standard price” more than $200 and less than $300?

##### 3.2.4.2. AND & OR operators in Where clause

The WHERE clause can contain several conditions linked by AND or OR.

In a WHERE containing one or more ANDs all specified  conditions must be true.

In a WHERE containing one or more ORs, at least one of the conditions must be true.

If you mix ANDs and ORs, the ANDs have precedence.

**Question**

Determine the value of X in the following statements: 

X = (Condition-1) AND (Condition-2) 
(Condition-1 is True) 
(Condition-2 is True) Then x=

X = (Condition-1) AND (Condition-2) 
(Condition-1 is True) 
(Condition-2 is False) Then x=

X = (Condition-1) OR (Condition-2) 
(Condition-1 is True)
(Condition-2 is False) Then x=

Question
 Determine the value of X based on AND and OR priorities

X = (1>2) AND (Sun is black) OR (sea is blue) AND (12< 14)

(1>2) AND (Sun is black) is False
(sea is blue) AND (12< 14) is True
x= False OR True
X is True

##### 3.2.4.3. Like operator in Where clause

Determine product description that end with word Table

Select productdescription from product_t 
Where productdescription Like ‘%Table’;
The LIKE operator allows you to compare strings using wildcards. 
For example, the % wildcard in ‘%Table’  indicates that all strings that have any number of characters preceding the word “Table” will be allowed.


SELECT Example–Boolean Operators and Like
AND, OR, NOT, and Like Operators for customizing conditions in WHERE clause

Question: Determine information about Desks or Tables with standard price more than $300.

SELECT Example–Boolean Operators and Like
SELECT Example–Boolean Operators
Parentheses override the normal precedence of Boolean operators.

SELECT Example–Boolean Operators

##### 3.2.4.4. “Is not null” Keyword in Where Clause

##### 3.2.4.5. In Operator in Where Clause

**Question**: Determine information about name, city and state of customers who lives in FL, TX, CA or HI states.
Select customername, customercity, customerstate 
from customer_t where customerstate like 'FL' OR customerstate like ‘TX' OR customerstate like ‘CA' OR customerstate like ‘HI‘;

Select customername, customercity, customerstate 
from customer_t where customerstate in ('FL','TX','CA','HI')

Note: The IN operator in this example allows you to include rows whose CustomerState value is either FL, TX, CA, or HI. 

Clauses of the SELECT statement:
SELECT
List the columns (and expressions) to be returned from the query
FROM
Indicate the table(s) or view(s) from which data will be obtained
WHERE
Indicate the conditions under which a row will be included in the result
GROUP BY
Indicate categorization of results 
HAVING
Indicate the conditions under which a category (group) will be included
ORDER BY
Sorts the result according to specified criteria
Sorting Results with ORDER BY Clause
Sort the results first by STATE, and within a state by the CUSTOMER NAME

### 3.3. SELECT Statement: Order By Clause

### 3.4. SELECT Statement: Group By Clause

Clauses of the SELECT statement:
SELECT
List the columns (and expressions) to be returned from the query
FROM
Indicate the table(s) or view(s) from which data will be obtained
WHERE
Indicate the conditions under which a row will be included in the result
GROUP BY
Indicate categorization of results 
HAVING
Indicate the conditions under which a category (group) will be included
ORDER BY
Sorts the result according to specified criteria

#### 3.4.1. Group By

Using group by:
 you can categorize your results into several groups, 
then analyse the data in each group based on your required information.

Aggregate functions such as AVG, SUM, MIN, MAX and COUNT can be used to analyse the data in each group
AVG function, short for “average”

COUNT function to find number of rows

Select * from customer_T;


Question: Determine the number of customers in each state.

Select customerstate, count(customerstate) from customer_t group by customerstate Order by customerstate;

#### 3.4.2.Categorizing Results Using GROUP BY Clause

For use with aggregate functions
Scalar aggregate: single value returned from SQL query with aggregate function
Vector aggregate: multiple values returned from SQL query with aggregate function (via GROUP BY)

Note: You can use single-value fields with aggregate functions if they are included in the GROUP BY clause

#### 3.4.3.Group by clause: Rule 1

#### 3.4.4. Group by clause: Rule 2

### 3.5 SELECT Statement: Having

Clauses of the SELECT statement:
HAVING
Indicate the conditions under which a category (group) will be included
ORDER BY
Sorts the result according to specified criteria

#### 3.5.1. Qualifying Results by Categories Using the HAVING Clause

HAVING uses with GROUP BY

HAVING after group by works like a WHERE clause, but HAVING operates on groups (categories), not on individual rows. 
Here, only those groups with total numbers greater than 1 will be included in final result.

#### 3.5.2. Having Clause

### 3.6. SQL statement processing order
As each cluse is processed, an intermediate results table is produced that will be used for the next clause.

User do not see the intermediate results tables; they only see the final results table.


## Summary (main information)
Clauses of the SELECT statement:
SELECT list the columns (and expressions) to be returned from the query
FROM indicate the table(s) or view(s) from which data will be obtained
WHERE (Comparison operators, AND, OR, is not null, in/not in, between) indicate the conditions under which a row will be included in the result
GROUP BY (using aggregate functions AVG, MIN, MAX, SUM and COUNT) indicate categorization of results 
HAVING indicate the conditions under which a category (group) will be included
ORDER BY Sorts the result according to specified criteria
Create View

### 3.7. Views

Tables are used to store data physically in database correspond to relations in logical database design. 
Using SQL queries it is possible to create virtual table or dynamic views.
virtual table or dynamic views can be manipulated like tables 

Create View syntax:
Create View View_Name as Select_Statement;

Example:
Create view P as select * from product_t;

Now P can be used as a table. Run the following query:

Select * from P;

Views provide users controlled access to tables
Base Table–table containing the raw data
Dynamic View
A “virtual table” created dynamically upon request by a user 
No data actually stored; instead data from base table made available to user
Based on SQL SELECT statement on base tables or other views
Materialized View
Copy or replication of data
Data actually stored
Must be refreshed periodically to match corresponding base tables

Simplify query commands
Assist with data security (but don't rely on views for security, there are more important security measures)
Enhance programming productivity
Contain most current base table data
Use little storage space
Provide customized view for user
Establish physical data independence

Use processing time each time view is referenced
May or may not be directly updateable

## Summary (main information)
