### New Orient Hospital Case Study

>New Oriental Hospital (NOH) is a small private hospital run by a team of medical professionals in a local suburb. According to hospital policy, **each patient has to fill in a patient registration form** on his/her first visit. On the patient registration form each patient is **uniquely identified using patient ID**, and the form records** registration date, patient’s personal details and insurance company details. Each patient must **nominate an insurance company**, which will pay the account directly to the hospital after the patient is discharged. NOH uses a separate system to manage payment processing. Information recorded on the registration form may be updated at any time without the need to fill in another registration form.
