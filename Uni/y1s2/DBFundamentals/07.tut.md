## CREATE TABLE STATEMENTS

A local pizza shop needs a new database to store the pizzas on their menu and the items on each pizza. The shop has a list of pizzas on their menu, a list of ingredients they use to make the pizzas and recipes of which ingredients go on which pizza. Compose the SQL script to create three tables, Menu, Items and Recipe, with the attributes included below.

- MENU_New (pizza, price, country, base)

```sql
CREATE TABLE MENU_new(
  pizza         varchar(20)     NOT NULL,
  price         float           NOT NULL,
  country       varchar(15),
  base          varchar(15),  
  PRIMARY KEY (pizza)
);
```

- ITEMS_New (ingredient, type)

```sql
CREATE TABLE ITEMS_new(
  ingredient    varchar(16)     NOT NULL,
  ingr_type     varchar(10)     NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (ingredient)
);

-- changed type to ingr_type be cause my ide highlighted "type" as a syntax
-- although I cant find anything on it
```

- RECIPE_New  (pizza*, ingredient*, amount)
  - FK (pizza) references MENU
  - FK (ingredient) references ITEMS

```sql
CREATE TABLE MENU_new(
  pizza         varchar(20)     NOT NULL,
  ingredient    varchar(16)     NOT NULL,
  amount        int             NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (pizza, ingredient),
  FOREIGN KEY (pizza)       REFERENCES Menu_new,
  FOREIGN KEY (ingredient)  REFERENCES ITEMS_new
);
```
