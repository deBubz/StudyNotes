## L1 Objectives

1. Why Databases and Intro to DBMS
2. Basic Concept of Db development
3. Db development on a conceptual level: ERD

## Why Databases and intro to DBMS

> Note: not examined, Just background information

### Using Db

- Centralized repository of shared data
- data managed by a controll agent
- Stored in a a standardized, convenient form

#### DBMS

- A software that can *define, create, maintain* a db. Provide *controlled access* to user databases

#### Component of the database

- **DataModeling and Design tools**: automated tools used for designing db and application programs
- **Repository**: Centralised storehouse for metadata
- **Database Management System**: software to manage db
- **Database** Stores data
- **Application Program**: software using data
- **UI**: text, graphical displays, menus.. gay
- **Data/Database Administrator**: personel responsible for maintaining the db
- **Systems Developers**: me
- **End Users**: casuals

### ANSI-SPARC architecture

- **External level(user view)**: only display relevant data to the users. Hides any unauthorised/ unrelevant data
- **Conceptual level**: what data is stored in the db and how are the data related. Doesnt specify how its stored physically. Detailed spec of the overal structure of organisational data( can be rep by an **entity-relationship diagram ERD**)
- **Internal Level** How data is represented physically. Describe how its stored in the db and the hardware.
  - **Logical datamodel(schema)**: DataModels specific to a `particular db approach`. e.g Relational Db must have `tabes`, `column`, `rows`, `pk`, `fk` and `constraints`
  - **Physical DataModel(Schema)**: specifications on how data from a logical data are stored in a comp's seccondary memory for a specific dbms

## 2. DataBaseDevelopment (Basic Concept)

- **Database**: Organised collection of logically related data
- **Data** stored representation and objects, events that have meaning/importance in the users environment
  - Structured: numbers, text, date
  - Unstructured: image, videos, docs
- **MetaData** Describe properties, characteristics(`datadype`, `file size`, `allowable values`, `data context`) of end-users data and its context
- **Information** Processed data

## 3.Database Development (conceptual Entity-relation Diagram ERD)

**Relational DB**: representing data as a `collection of tables`, where all data relationship are represented as `acommon value`(PK- FK) in each tables

### Enterprise Data Model

Dev Steps

1. specify scope in general content
2. High level absctraction
3. Business Rules
4. Entity-Relationship Diagrams & description of entity types.
5. Relationship btween entities(tables)

#### 3.2 HighLevel Abstraction

#### 3.3 Business Rules

- **Statements** that define/**constraint** some business aspects
- often derived from **policies**, **events**, **functions**, **procedures**
- Assert Business Structure, Controll Business behaviour
- Expressed in terms familiar to casuals
- Automated through **bdms** software

**Business Rules** are often used to determine **entities**, **attributes**, **attribute types**, **identifiers**, **relationship**

##### Good Business Rules

- Declarative - what
- Precise - clear
- Atomic - one statemt
- Consistent - internaly and externaly
- Expressable - structured, natural lang
- Disctinct - non-redundants
- Business Oriented - easy to understand by normies(business people)

#### Good Data Name

- related to busines/ non-techical (why)
- meaningful, self-documenting
- unique but readable and repeatable

#### 4 & 5 E-R Model constuct( conceptual level)

**Data Model** is a `graphical system` used to capture the nature/relationships of data, made up **entities**, **attribute**, **relationships** (most commin is ERD)

- **entities** (table)
- **Attribute** (Columnns) properties/characteristics of entity/relationship
- **Relationship** links between entities

## Entities

TEH TABLES ez enuff

**Entities Type**: collection of entities that shares `common` properties. Entity Types are `templates` for entity instances

**Entity Instance**: Single occurance of entity type (rows in a table) (1 reading/ data entry = 1 instance)

## Attributes

Attributes are properties/characteristics of an entity/relationship type(Fields in a table)

**Classifications** of attributes
- Required or Optional
- Simple or Composite
- Single/Multivalued
- Stored or Derrived
- Identifiers

## Relationship

### Keyfields

- PK : Unique Identifyer of each Entity Instance
- FK : Enable Relation
-
