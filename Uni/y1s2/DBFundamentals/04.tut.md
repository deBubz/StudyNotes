# Week 4

## Lecture Activity

1. Explain why there is 1:m relationship between 2 entities, PK of the 1-side will be the FK on the m-side. Provide explanation with an example

Lets try putting the PK of m-side as FK for the 1-side, this is an example of a bookstore db storing information about books, it contains 2 entities Genre(books genre) ad Book(book details)

The relationship is Book m:1 Genre

| GenreID | GenreName | GenreTotal| BookID |
|---|---|---|---|
| c001 | Adventure | 9 | b001, b002, b004|
| c002 | Thriller | 0 |
| c003 | Romance | 6 | b003 |

|BookId| BookName| BookQuant |
|---|---|---|
|b0001| Journey To the center of the earth | 4 |
|b002 | 20000 leagues under the seas |2|
|b003 | Spring Snow | 6 |
|b004 | Around the world in 80 days| 3|

As you can see, if there are more instances of books of the same Genre, it will clutter up the BookID fk in the Genre entity (1-side), turning the BookID into a multivalue attribute will making it extremely harder to store data as the ammount of data increases.

Therefore, the PK of the 1-side should be the FK in the m-side

| GenreID | GenreName | GenreTotal|
|---|---|---|---|
| c001 | Adventure | 9 |
| c002 | Thriller | 0 |
| c003 | Romance | 6 |

|BookId| BookName| BookQuant | GenreID
|---|---|---|---|
|b0001| Journey To the center of the earth | 4 | c001|
|b002 | 20000 leagues under the seas |2| c001 |
|b003 | Spring Snow | 6 | c003 |
|b004 | Around the world in 80 days| 3| c001|

2. Redesign the following entity

> Where every employee needs to have atleast one skill & evvery skill can be chosen by an employee. In addition, the information about skills like skill ID and name need to be stored in the db.

Explain **why** this needs to be redesigned & convert the new ERD to **relations**

3 Entity: Employee, Skill, EmployeeSkill(associated)

- **Employee**( <u>EmployeeID</u>, EmployeeName, EmployeeRole)
- **EmployeeSkill**(<u>EmployeeID</u>, SkillID, ExperienceLevel)
- **Skill**(<u>SkillID</u>, SkillName, SkillType)

This needs to be redesigned into 2 Strong Ent and 1 Associated Entity because as the Business Rule states `employee need to have atleast 1 skill & every skill can be chosen by any employee` meaning many employee could have more than 1 skill. The relation the 2 entity became Skill Opt m:m Mandatory Employee & an associated entity is needed to breakup the m:m relationship

3. **Convert the associative entity to a relation**

- **Customer**: <u> CustomerID</u>, CustomerName
- **Shipment**: <u> ShipmentID, ShipmentDate</u>, ShipmentAmount, CustomerID, VendorID
- **Vendor**: <u>VendorID</u>, VendorAddress

```md
CUSTOMER(<u> CustomerID </u>, CustomerName)
VENDOR(<u> VendorID </u>, VendorAddress)

SHIPMENT(<u> ShipmentID, ShipmentDate</u>, ShipmentAmount, CustomerID*, VendorID*) 
FK (CustomerID) references CUSTOMER 
FK (VendorID) references VENDOR
```
