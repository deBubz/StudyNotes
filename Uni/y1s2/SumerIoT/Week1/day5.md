## Profile contents

### Intro (main mage)

### Problem (summer studio main page)

- This Summer Studio I'm attending recomends to build something personal.
- I often take night walks when Im stressed out from everyday life. The problem is the street lights around my walking route are often broken. You would think the local council is responsible for keeping the lights maintained, but they are often non-functional for several weeks at a time.
- Having a quick look online, it reveals some of NSW's light system still relies on an inefficient reporting system.`links`
- So there, from this IoT Studio. I want to develop a system that tracks and report whenever there is an issue with the lights. This system would also be used to generate data that could reveal more deeper problem in the existing infastructure.

### Learning contract

What do I want to gain out of this studio?

I want to gain a develop my programming skills, learn other frameworks and have a better insight in other proffessions (electronics, networking)

#### specifics

1. basic understanding in electronics
   - **What?** i want to learn the basic structure of a circuit and see how data moves around. lets keep it simple and start with one circuit and one sensor
   - **how?** `resources`: more than half of the studio are Electronics Engineering majors and Dannon works and teaches it, ask them for help. `Time commitment`: atleast 1 whole day perweek focusing wholely on electronics
1. Building db on a virtual server on the Cli
   - 
   - how? resources, time allocation/ commitments
1. three
   - What do I want to achieve
   - how? resources, time allocation/ commitments

#### Sprint 1  Week 1

**What I learned this sprint**

- **Evaluation**
  - I walked in to this studio, expected to have a structure where the superviser would show everyone how to do certain things. The reality is I need to figgure out what I want from the studio for my self, and ultimately know how to work independently without supervision.

- **Achievement**

  - 

- **Problems**
  - I dont know when to stop researching when the problem is out of my expertise, and ask **questions**
  - Switching to a different topics each time I hit a wall, wasted researching time.
  - 
- **Reflection**
  - shits tough
  - I need to focus on one topic at a time
  - Don't give up
  - KISS - Keep it Simple Stupid
  - Talk more, ask **more questions**
