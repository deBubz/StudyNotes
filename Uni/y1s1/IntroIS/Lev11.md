## Systems Development is Difficult and Risky

## Traditional System Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

Traditional system development method that organizations use larfe-scale IS projects.
The __SDLC__ is a structured framework that consist of swquential process by which IS are developed

- __System Investigation__
- __System Analysis__
- __System Design__
- __Programming and Testing__
- __Implementation__
- __Operation and Maintenance__

---

## Tools/Approaches for systems development

- __Prototyping__
- __Computer-Assisted Software Engineering (CASE)__
  - __Uppercase tool__
  - __Lower case Tools__
  - __Intergrated CASE (ICASE)__
- __Component-Based Development__
- __Objected-orientred Development__

---

## Alternate Methods for System Development

### Joint Application Design (JAD)

- Group-based approach for collecting user req and creating System Design
- Most used within the system analysis and system design of the SDLC
- System analyst/Developers and users joinlt define, review and agree on the requirements

### Rapid Application Development (RAD)

- System Dev method taht can combine JAD, prototyping and intergrated computer-asssisted software engineering (ICASE) tools to quicly produce highquality systems
- use to speedup the syst development process and generally include
  - __Requirement planning phase__: users and analysy identify objective of the app or system to identify infor requirements. Requires intense involvement from users at different levels of the org. Purpose is to solve business problem
  - __RAD design Workshop__
  - __Implementation phase__

---

### __Agile__

- a methodology that delivers functionality in rapid iterations
- Req and solutions evolve through collaborations between self-organizing, cross-functional teams.
- Requires Freq communications and collaborations, development, testing and delivery.
