1. Data management

## Objectives

- Ways that common challanges in managing data can be addressed using data governance
- advantages of relational databases
- Whats Big Data, what are its basic characteristics
- What are some knowledge management systems in organisations

----

## Data management and accurate, timely information

- The need to accuarately and timely manage data has never been so strong.
- The main purpose is to reduce error and maintain a competitive advantage.
- The need for data to be accurate is to let managers make informed decisions

### Difficulties of managing data and why?

- Exponentially increasing amount of data recorded
- Data comes from multiple different sources, needs to sort it
- Data rot (Outdated, destroyed, forgery?, hardware wear and tear), needs staff to manage that.
- inconsistent, conflicting due to non- intergrated information system.
- Mananging sound data is very vital to the business

### How do organisations manage the avaibility, usability, reliability, integrity and security of company data?

#### Data governance

- Data Governance is a set of enforcable __standard policies__ on how to handle data in an organization.
- Enforcable standards, Managing data entegrity
- Consist of how data is gathered, stored, accessesd, backed up.

#### Data Governance process

1. established data governance
   - Identify and define what policies are needed.
   - establish data governance council.
1. define standard data policies
1. Enforcement
1. Audit, Monitor , control
   - regular inspections to see if these policies are followed

#### Problems with traditional File systems

- __Data Redundancy__ repetition, cause inconsistency and storage issues
- __Data Inconsistency__ data not updated.
- __Poor Security__ who can access it.
- __Poor Data Sharing Ability__ hard to share in a timely matter

## Database

Data Storing Technology that can easily centralise all stored data. Databases are often used along with data Governance.

### Advantages of databases

- Minimal Redundancy
- improved consistency
- improved security
- improved accesibility for sharing
- enforcement of standard
- improved data quality

Data bases are are managed using a Datamase Management System __(DBMS)__. Easily users __CRUD__ functions, which are __C__ reate, __R__ emove, __U__ pdate, __D__ elete.  

### Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)

- Diagrams which represents _entities_ and their _relationships_ in a database.

### Data warehouse and Data Mart

If an organisation find they dont have data, they can access:

- __Data Warehouse__: Collections of information, collected by operational databases(from other orgs) that supports business activities and decesion making.

- __Data Mart__ : A scaled down version of a data warehouse designed for end-users need in an individual department.

## BigData

### Data mining

## Knowledge Management

The procedure what companies uses to get more value from their knowledge assets.

Km can be explicite or tacit

### Knowledge Management Cycle

- __create__ : As people figgures out new and different ways to do things.
- __capture__ : knowledge identified and presented in a meaningful way.
- __refine__ : knowledge refined and put in actionable context. Tacit knowledge must be captured along with explicit facts.
- __storage__ : knowledge stored in reasonable and accesible formats.
- __manage__ : 
- __disseminate__ : 

### Knowledge Management System __KMS__

- Refers to a collection of systems that is used for the genaration, storage, sharing and management of valuable tacit & explicit knowledge.

## case study : nzld flubys

- use big data(transactions shopping) from the flybys card to detect pattern and behaviour, hence, can suggest products and services to more suit the comsumer`s need.
- use the flyby card also to issue rewards, therefore improving loyalty.
