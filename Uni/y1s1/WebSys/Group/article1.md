According to [the artivle](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/object-oriented-programming-concepts-21bb035f7260), 4 main principle of oop are:

- __Encapsulation__:
    - This is achieved when obj keep its data/variables `private`, inaccesable by other objects unless its declared `public`.
- __Abstraction__:
    - Can be thought as an extension of encapsulation, and is used to simplify big projects.

- __Inheritance__:
    - Used to reuse logic, reducing repetition.
    - Child class can use method from its parents class.
- __Polymorphism__:
    - Extension of Inheritance.
    - Allow child classes to reuse and modify methods from the parent class.

__NOTE__: how to explain this to non programmers.
