# IoT

Where does IoT exist:

- Everything
- Health
- Agriculture
- Bussiness
- Personal use

what can I do with this

- Securiy
- Big Data
- Reliance, Over Reliance?

What are the questions

- Security:
  - Is it safe enough
  - How Secure are they
  - what can happen if its breached
- Data
  - transparancy in data collection. Should the end user be notified of any/all of the data transactions?
  - Privacy
  - end users option to Opt-in Opt out.
