Hello Am I Speaking to Jason Mansfield

My name is Bao and I am a student studing IT at UTS and I am working on a vodcast to present to my peers about being a Project manager.

I am calling to ask if you would be interested in this project.
I would love to interview you about your experiences within the career as well as find out about the day-to-day tasks you perform. ETC. The interview will only take half an hour and I, along with my team, can come to you.

The interview is going to be recorded and would only be shown to my peers. Me and a few of my team members are studying software development, but we are also very interested to learn of what would it be like being a profect manager.

If you are interested, I can send you the questions in more detailed through email.
