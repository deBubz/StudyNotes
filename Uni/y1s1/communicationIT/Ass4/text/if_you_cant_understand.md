# If you can’t understand it, you can’t properly assess it! The reality of assessing security risks in Internet of Things systems

## Jason R C Nurse, Petar Radanliev, Sadie Creese, David De Roure

## Abstract

- As complexity, pervasiveness and automation of technology  systems increases, esp IoT, we will need new approach to risk aseess and build system trust.
- Report, Scoping workshops and interview with industry proffesional (Enterprise systems, IoT and Risk) to validate the above arguement.
- Consult with proffessionals to understand:
  - Identify wider concerns of corporations in adopting IoT systems(smart manufactoring floor or a smart office)
  - Challanges for industry that attempts to properly addresses the Risks of IoT.

## Introduction

IoT is set to change our society just as the internet it self. Beside from being a buzzwordm, IoT is a complex technology paradigm.
It represents the __convergence of varying visions__ for the future of IoT, multiple people have a different vision for IoT(ref 1)

Although it stands to provide increased productivity and efficientcy in manufacturing and argiculture. Massive economic impact, predicted to reach 4 trillion per year.
Could create a new paragdigm to save lives in __smart health__.

But there are also challanges with its wide spread use. Threats can originate fom physical or cyber attacks. can target __any central layers of an IoT system__.
Many are known to have shortcommings interms of security and  privacy.

organisations conditioned to response to threats and vulnerabilities through the process of __Risk assessment__.

Assessment use methadologies based from: __National Institite of Standards and Technologu (NIST)__ Special Publication, Industry-developed standards ISO 27000 series.

Aim to Identify relevant assets, vulnerabilities and threats, Impatcs.

Howeverm there are some issues will impact the application of existing sec assessment methods to IoT Systems. This Includes inadequate of current __periodic assessments__, Unknown System boundaries at the time of assessment, fail to acknowledge __assessts as attack vectors__ instead of just value.

> Overall, manufactures often ignores the product after production/ does not seem the importance of periodical update their devices.

### This report

- scopinng workshops
- Intervire with professionals from indystry and vusiness sector.

Goal to: validate stated issues and their significance.
The paper `"believe that the IoT security research field in general stands to benefid from this stakleholder engagement."` as it addressess concerns from the industry and informing future research.

### Structure
