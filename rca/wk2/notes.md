## programming language 

why `c`

- simple api
- less existing libraries
- not OO
- efficient in memory usage
  - less instructions
  - access hardware directly such as IO ports

### datatype

> take care of datatypes

- take care of which data type to use
- int can have different size depending on the processor 

> yep you know all this

## 2's compliment

- computers cannot subtract
- computers can only add
- 2's compliment allow addition and subtraction

## bitwise operations

- & and
- | or
- ^ xor
- ~ not

## bit mask

OH so this is quickly assigning value/ setting the default value regardless of the input

- 0 & is always 0
- 1 | is always 1
- 0 | x is always x
- 1 & x is always x

## shift shift operator

shift bytes left or right by a number of bits

- << left shift
- \>\> right shift
