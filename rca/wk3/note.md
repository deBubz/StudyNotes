## time order behaviour

- circle diagram
- diagram to visualize the main `while(1)` loop

> the code functionality is pretty confusing


## state machine 

- computation model for capturing time ordered behaviour
- **state** defined in the circle
- **transition** the line connecting the circle labeled with a condition
- arrows usually accompany with condition
- empty arrow usually means power up/ startup
