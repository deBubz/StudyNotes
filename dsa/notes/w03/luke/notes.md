# Vid 3 notes

- **Vectors**
  - List provide an alternative for arrays but doesnt guarantee how memory is managed
  - List have more overhead, different to arrays
  - vectors are middle ground to array/linked list
  - Think as dynamically sized arrays
  - In the back end, vectors are almost the same as arrays with the ability to handle size allocation
- **Templates**
  - assign specific data type of data structures. e.g `vector<int>`
    - easily make vector hold different types
  - does not change the functions of the DS, beside telling what size of memory will be allocated.
    - java/c# generics
    - provide way to write certain type of code where it doesnt care of the type
  - Easy to work with, but more prone to errors
  - work at runtime
- **Iterators**
  - something `tail()`, iterators in java well put together. all look the same from the outside
  - Its more flexible in `c++` but expect ugly code.
  - `getHead()` first of linked list, `tail()` last of linked list
- **Algo Analysis**
  - Big O Notation, how to compare algorithms ( via speed and memory )
