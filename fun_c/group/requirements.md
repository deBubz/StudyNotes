# Group project descriptions

- 2 **deliverables**
- 3 **checkpoints**


## d1: source code

- `c` files, `header` files and 1 `makefile`, submit through **ED**
- WRITE GENERAL COMMENTS IN `main.c`
  - include compilation instruction (lets also do this in README)
- **NOTE**:
  - coding style, modularity (what is double inclusion)
  - features and *aesthetics* of the program
    - what the fuck ui, aight just print pretty shit
    - many runtime modes that uses many different arguements
  - data compression/encryotion techniques ohboy
    - "reasonably" complex algos (sorting, searching)
    - use stack, queue, linkedlist, tree
  - lmao imagine having 0 bugs
    - debug mode printing useful debug mode? 

## d2: project report

- NOTE:
  - Objective, scope and program features
  - Explain the design and the reasoning behind it
  - Critical Thinking (encountered problems, what happened good/bad)
  - General Presentation of the report

## Description 

- realworld data manipulation involving compressiion an/or encryption
  - atleast ONE compoent of compression/encryption
- **WHAT WE MAKING**
- team workstuff
  - each person handle some functions
- only use these libraries  `stdio, stdlib, string and math`
- follow **SDLC**:
  - gather requirements
  - analyze requirements
  - design solution
  - implement and test

## Timeline

### wk 08 **CHECKPOINT 1**

- agree on project to work on
- note down some header files
- what is a structure chart
- report outline 

### wk 09

- implement some functions/algos
- some debugging and integration

### wk 10 **CHECKPOINT 2**

- continuing working on functions
- doccument bugs, how to reproduce the bugs, how to stop them
- Keep working on the project

### wk 11 **CHECKPOINT 3**

- Final changes on the program/report if needed
