# Week 01

seems simple and basic enough, just some basic programming stuff

## Development steps

- figure out requirements
- problem analysis
- solution design
- implement, test

## printf and scanf

> coverage is very basic, lets just rely on the content from the prescribed book and the one im going through

## errors

- **Compilation errors** - code error, the `compiler` will mostlikely pick this up
- **Logical Errors** - logic errors, only the dev can spot this from testing the program
- **Runtime Errors** - edge cases, errors occuring when running the program. you can check through testing, im looking at you variables
