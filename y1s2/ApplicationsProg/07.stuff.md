# Week 7 stuff

## System Design

- something about relationships between classes
- location table, to see what class does what, see comon functions 

## Interface

- declares common methods to multiple classes
- each class provide its own 'implementation'

```java
public interface Polugon {
    public doble area();
    public int sideNo();
}
```

```java
public class Square implements Polygon {
    @Override public double area() {}
}
```

- aww yis `polymorphism`

## SuperClasses

- makes method abstracts instead
-  implement their own function
-  single inheritance only for subclasses

```java
public abstract class Polygon{
    protected double x;
    protected double y; // only subclass

    public abstract double area() // to be overide

    public void move(double dx, double dy) {
        x += dx; y += dy;
    }
}
```

```java
public class Square extends Polygon{
    //...
}

```
