# Class

## Classes v Procedural

### Procedural

- Each program element is global
- Dependencies btween elements are not well-structured/unclear
- Not Clear how to subdivide the work among team
- Not clear what impact a change will have

### OOP classes

- Seperate of concern
- Easy to manage dependancies
- can export **Interface**, hide implementation detail while are able to change internal details without disrupting other objects
- Better map out a large, complex program.

### Instance/ static

- Static
  - publicly availible, no need to instantiate new object
- Instance
  - attatched with the object

### Access Modifiers

- **no modifier**: can access within the package
- **private**: only within the class
- **public**: can access by other classes
- **protected**: subclasses
- ***final***: constants for fields, unchangeable, normal public, static. Variable name is ALL_UPPERCASE

### Getters and setters methods

- Fields are usually private.
- Getters and/or setters can be implement to access private fields
- to achieve hide by default rule.

## Design rules

- **Encapsulation**
- **Push-it-right**
- **Spread accross classes**
- **Hide by default**

## Process

- **Word-to-Code**
