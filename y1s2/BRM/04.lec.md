## Week 4

# Business Process Modelling

## Objectives

- Appreciate how modelling techniques can help to understand the working of business systems
- Discover how modelling can be used to specify system & user requirements
- Discover how **Business Process Model** (BPM) can be used to model, analyse & understand the business processes in an organisation

Main Topics: 2nd stage of Business Requirements

- Requirement Analysis & Modelling
- Business Process Modelling using BPMN

## Requirement Analysis

Review - How are requirements collected?

- Through Planning & Requirement Elicitation techniques such as Interviews, workshops, prototyping, surveys, observation, doccument review...

Learining Objective - How do we analyse & model these requirements? Business Process Modelling BPM

## Business Process

- Expert from IT & business engineering disciplines argue that successful systems deployment starts with the understanding of the Business Process of an org
- a Business Process:
  - has astrong emphasis on how work is done within an org
  - is the combination of a set of activities within an enterprise with a structure describing their logical order & dependence, whose objective is to produce a desired result
  - is a collection of activities designed to produce a specific output for a particular customer.
  - a specific ordering of work activities, with a begining-end, clearly defined I/O
  
## Intro to Bussiness Process Modeling

- BPM in systems engineering is the activity of representing process of an enterprise, so that the current process maybe analyzed or improved
- Conceptual Modeling of a BusinessProcess is performed
  - To facilitate the development of software that supports the business processes
  - To permit the analysis & improvement of the business process
- Modelling of a business process typically show evets, actions & links/conneection points in a logical order from end-end

### Process Decomposition

- breaking down a large/complex process to be more easily understood
- Decomposition is te process of starting at a high level & dividing entities into smaller & smaller related parts
- main purpose is to breakup large/complex business process into smaller & more manageble chunks/componets (sub-processes & tasks)

It facilitates understanding of the business process & hence is a useful tool in conducting analysis & design

Context lvl > First lvl > Second lvl

### Context Diagram

- System Context Diagram (SCD) is a diagram that defines the boundary btween the system, or part of it, & its env, showing entities that interact with it
- Context Diagram allows a team/individual to produce a high-lvl model of an existing or planned system that defines the boundary of the system of interest & its interactions with te critical elemts in its environment
- Context Diagram shows (parts/components)
  - The System that's being analyzed
  - Entities(other syst, prople, org) that interacts with the system
  - Information/Data (not processes) that flows btween the system and each entity

#### Why context Diagram

It can

- help define & agree the scope/boundary of the system of interest
- privide a simple high-lvl picture (birds-eye view) of the system of interest
- Help ID the elements in the env of the syst of interest that it interacts with. All syst operates in an env; failure to pay attentiion to that environment will cause failure
- ID & define the external interfaces the Syst of Interest logically has to have with the outside world

See Diagram in slides 13-14

#### lvl 1 & lvl 2 diagrams

- lv1: ID all processes (main functions/features/ work activities) withinthe System
- lv2: 
  - Detail/ model all sub-processes and tasks within each process ID at lv1
  - ID all task from start to end required to complete each lv1 process and draw 1 seperate diagrams for each lv1 process

#### ATM model from w3 case study

- Context
  - ID all external entities + info that flows btween ATm system & entities
- lv1: all process within the ATM system
  1. Withdraw
  2. Transfer Money
  3. Deposit
  4. Change pin
- lv2:
  - Detail/model each subprocesses & tasks within each process IDed at lv1. ID all task from the start-end required to complete each lv1 Process, Draw one seperate diagram for each lv1 process

## Business Process Modeling Notation BPMN

- standard notation for business process modeling
- Primary objective of BPMN is to provide a standard notation that is readily understandable by all business users, from analyst(creates initial drafts of the process) to technical devs (whom implements the tech that performs the processes) to the business people(whom manages/monitors those process)
- BPMN defines a Business Process Diagram, based on a flowcharting technique tailored for creating a graphical models of business process operations
- BPM = network of graphical objects(activities) and flow control(order of performance)

### Notations

- **Events**(circle): trigger this event if this a condition is met
- **Activity**(rounded rectangle): functions
- **Gateway**(diamond): fork/merging/joining of sequence
- **Sequence** Flow(solid arrow line): order of activities
- **Message Flow**(dotted arrow line): flow of message btween participants
- **Association**(dotted line/arrow): associate information with Flow objects
- **Pool**(big textbos with a header cell): represent a participan in a process. Usually act as a container for a partitioning set of activities from other pools
- **lane**(seperate column in pool): self explanatory
- **DataObj**(file icon): artifacts, they dont have a direct effect on the sequence/message flow of the process.
- **Group**(dotted rect): grouping related activities for documentation purposes

## HOMEWORK

Try

- draw Lv2 Diagram for WithdrawMoney using Correct BPMN notations
- ID sub-processes & task within "withdraw money" process that completes the process of withdrawing money
- make sure these activites/task are ordered ina correct sequence & flow logically from start-end

## REVIEW

### OBJECTIVES of BPM

- understand the current business process
- understand how work is done in an org
- clarifyinf responsibilities
- id process inefficiencies
- support continuous process improvement
- support process management
- support process development
- support process execution

### RESULTS and BENEFITS of BPM

- improve on current processes
- create better value for customers
- reduce cost
- increase profit & competitiveness
- better staff morale?
- customer retention
