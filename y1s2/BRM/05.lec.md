# Data Modelling

## Objective

- appreciate how modelling techniques can help understanding the working of business system
- Discover how modelling can be used to specify system & user requirements
- Discover how EntityRelationshipDiagram(ERD) can be used to model, analyse & understand the Data requirements of an Organisation

## Topic

Requirement Analysis & Modelling

- Data Modelling using ERD

## Review Requiremtne Analysis

- Previously - How are requiremtns collected
  - Interviews, Workshop, Questionairs, Prototype, Observation, Document review
- Now - How do we analyse & model these requiremtns?
  - Data Modelling(ERD)

---

## Data Model

- identifies entities/ objects that the org will need to store data about
- describe the data that must be captured, stored & retrieved
- Descrives the data in a logical manner (conceptual)
- Creates a graphical representation of the entities and the relationshop btween entities
- Focus on What data is required * how it should be organiesed
- ITs a plan for building a db

### Entity-Relationship Diagram as a DataModel

- Using ERD as DataModel is
  - an abstraction of the data the organisaion interfaces with
  - a way to organise the data into a standardised structure
- ERD is a graphical representation of the DataRequirements for a db
- ERD is a grapgical Representation of the entities relevant to a chiosen problem domain, the relationship btween them & their attributes
- ERM is a conceptual Datamodel that views the real world as consisting of entites & relationship
- Basic ERD concept
  - Entities
  - Relationship
  - Attributes
  - Cardinality
- WHY ERD?
  - Descrives the data requirement sof the business
  - Represent the business rules that apply to an organizztions data
  - Confirms business, data requirements & provide direction to the architecture & design team as they modve forward with db design

### ERD v Process Model

- ERD captures important data in the org, ProcessModels capture the business processes in an org
- ERD focuses on data to be stored & retrieved in an efficient manner, it shows relationship btween data. Where ProcessModel sbows BusinessProcess so that the process can be analysed & improved

### ERD

#### Entity Types

- Table in the DB
- PLace, person, thin, events, concpets about which we wish to record information
- Can be classifien into different types
- Entity Tpe classify things about which we want to store data
- Look for NOUNS to identify entites

#### Attributes

- all entities have attributes(properties) that descrive the characteristics of an entity. Student(<u>StudentID</u>, Name, Address...)
- all **Instances** of an entity type/set have the same attributes.
- Values of attributes will vary for each instance
- Attribute become colimns in a table db
- Dont make a big list of attributes for each entity. Only store data that are important to the organisation and the & the ones that are in scoped of that particular project
- Each Instance of an Entity is called a **record**, row in a table

#### Entity Keys

- Keys are
  - basis of relationship btween entities
  - logical & physical pointer
  - used to identify another entity that the curront one wishes to be associated with
- Finding & Identifying keys is important in understanding the requirements for an information system.

##### Keys- Primary Keys

- attribute/ group of attribute that uniquely id an instance of an entity
- PK must be unique
  - no dupes, often numeric

##### Keys - Foreign Key

- attribute use to identify as an instance of another entity type
- PK of one entity is used in another table, to show relation

### Relationship

- A relationship connects entities to each other. It is an association among 2 or more entites
- In ERD, relationships is indicated by a verb connecting 2or more entities
- They are significant business association btween entities

### Cardinality

- ITs a business rule to indicate howmany entities may participate in the given relationship btween entities
- way to specify num of occurences of one entity in a data model that are linked to a seccond entity
- Types
  - 1:0
  - 1:1
  - 1:N  (one-many)
  - M:N  (many-many) (need associative entity to break up the M:M relationship)

### Composite PK

- mainly used for associative entites

## Steps for Drawing ERD

- ID the entities/ nouns in specification, requirement documents, interview transcript
- ID the attributes for each entity
- ID the relationship btween entites
- ID cardinality
- ID keys (both PK & FK) for each entity

## Data Dictionary

- centralized repository of information about data such as meaning, relationships to other data, origin, usage & format
- File that defines the basic organization of a database
- Data dictionary contains a list of all files in the db, number of records in each file, & the names & types of each field
- Contains a read-only set of tables that provide information about the database
- AttributeName, Datatype, Size, Description

## Database Design (optional)

- Entity are implemented as relational tables
- Properties of Entities are implemented as attributes in the relational tables
- Composite PK of an associative entity is a PK of a new relational table
- If 1:N cardinality, FK will be at m-side
- 1:1 cardinality, FK can be placed at either table

## Summary

- EntityRelationship Diagram are the basis for db design
- ERD capture the data requirements of the system
- ERD are structured around Unique Keys
