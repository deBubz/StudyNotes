## Objectives

- Understand the requirement process in the syst development process
- Its stages and activities
- Identify stakeholders and understand who they are

## Topics

### System Development process

**Agile dev process**: development method where solutions evolved through collaborations. it promotes adaptive planning, evolutionary development, eaerly delivery, continuous inprovement.
  - stuff bout **scrums**

**Waterfall dev process**: sequential design, progress is seen as a flowing steadily downwards through different phases

#### Requirement process

- Req Gathering process:
  - **Orderly process** to corretly complete complete requiremnets, a Requirement process is needed.
  - **Process** are steps of phases in the SDLC
  - its a structure imposed on the SDLC
  - each phases procudes deliverables
- steps of requirements process, (different `stages/phases`)
  - Negotiation, prioritising & Management
    - Planning & Elicitation
      - Modelling & Analysis
        - Specification & Documentation
          - Validation & Inspection
- Requirement process includes
  - Stages/Phases
  - Requirements Activities & Tasks
    - **Identified**
    - **Captured**
    - **managed**
    - **Communicated**
    - **prioritised**
    - **estimated**
    - scoped
    - **de-scoped**
    - **signed off**
  - Techniques & Tools
  - Identifying Stakeholders & their needs
  - Doccument the requirements in a **model** that allow
    - Analysis
    - communication
    - subsequent implementation

#### Requirements Engineering

Refers to the Process of **defining**, **doccumenting** & **maintaining** requirements and to the subfields of systems engineering & software engineering concerened with this process `wtf`

- Requirement Quality: `SMART`
  - **S**pecific, Simple: free from miss-interpretation
  - **M**easurable, Managable: Alow **verification** of the finished product
  - **A**ttainable:
  - **R**ealistic: lol relax with the features, set some constraints
  - **T**ime-bound
- **Types** of Requirements
  - **Functional**:
    - Describe the behavior and the info that the sln will manage
    - must contain essential functions
    - Things your product **must** do as the **requirement**
  - **Non-Functional**
    - fluff
    - to buffup the **quality** of the system
- Requirements Activities. They are:

- Requirement **Elicitation**
  - Process of **seeking**, **uncovering**, **acquiring** & **elaborating** requirements for a PC based system `discovery phase`
  - Requiements are elicited rather than just captured or collected, This implies there are discovery, Emergence & development elements to the elicitation process
  - Complex process involving many activities with a variety of availiable techniques, approaches & tools
  - Stakeholder Analysis
- Requirement Elicitation **Techniques**
  - Brain Storming with stakeholders 
  - Interviews
  - Requirement Workshops
  - Doccument Analysis within the org
  - Observation
  - Prototyping wireframes, models
  - Survey questionairs

#### Requirement Process Stages:

- **Analysis**
- **Modeling**:
  - Diagrams, models that focuses on a specific aspect of the system (BVBM, ERD)
- **Specification**:
  - After analysing & modeling the requirements, they are specified & documented in a software requirement specification **(srs A2)** doc
- **Verification** & **Validation**:
  - checking doc requirements & models are consistent & meet stakeholder needs.
  - does it meets the stakeholder's needs
- **Management**:
  - Process of **documenting**, **analyzing**, **tracing**, **prioritizing** & **agreeing** on requirements then controlling change & communication to relevent stakeholders
  - continuous process
  - ensure organization documents, verifies & meet expectation/needs of customers and stakeholders.
  - **Tools**:
    - Requirement Backlog
    - Requirements Register or Spreadsheets
    - IBM Jazzhub
    - JIRA

#### Stakeholders

- Stakeholders:
  - **Individuals**, or **organisations** who are interested or could influence the devlopment of the requirements and software system projects
  - Could have different roles based on their interest & responsibility of the organisation
  - Failure to discover all stakeholders could lead to the failure to meet their needs
- Stakeholder classes:
  - **Sponsor**: Owner representative, Pays for the development of the product.
  - **Owner**
  - **ProjectManager**
  - **Business Analyst (Bleh)**
  - **Quantity Analyst**
  - **Customer**: They buy the product when its developed
  - **Supplier**
  - **End-User**: Consumer, buys the product, hands on operator of the product
  - **Subject Matter Expert (SME)**: People who knows their shit, specialized knowledge of a the business subject
  - **Support Proff**
  - **Regulator**

## Stakeholder ANalysis

- Slide 26, important quest that can help with identifying & understanding stakeholders
- 2 techniques
  - Stakeholder list/map/register
  - Empathy map
- Why Stakeholder Analyisis
  - Analysis involve identifying all relevent stakeholders & understanding their needs
  - To beter understand the importand & inflicence infic dstakeholders on projecy
  - to get better support from stakeholders with more resources, better ensureing sucess to project

### Empathy map

- Tool used to get deeper insight into customers or even stakeholders
- Help us consider whet they feel thing see say, hear. how they percieve the product.
