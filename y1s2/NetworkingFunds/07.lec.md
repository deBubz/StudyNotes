## Overview of NetworkLayer

- transport segment from **sending** to **receiving** host
- Sender encapsulates segments into datagrams
- Reciever delivers segments to transport layer
- network layer protocols are present in every host, router
- The router examines header fields from all IP datagrams passing through it

### Two key network-layer functions

- **network-layer functions**:
  - **routing**: determine the route taken by packets from source to destination (routing algorithms)
- **forwarding**: move packets from router’s input to appropriate router output

###Network layer: data plane, control plane

- **Control Plane**
  - Network-wide logic
  - determines how datagram is routed among routers along end-to-end path from Source Host -> Destination Host
  - 2 controll-plane approaches:
  - *Traditional routing algos* implemented in routers
  - *Software-defined networking* (SND) implemented in routers
- **Data plane**
  - local, per-router function
  - determines how datagram arriving to router input port is **forwarded** to router output port
  - forwarding function

### Per-router control plane

- Indiv routing algos components in *each and every router* interact in the control plane

### Logically centralized control plane

A disctict (typically remote) controller interacts with local control agents(CAs)

### Network service model

- **Q** what service model for **channel** transporting datagrams from sender to reciever?

| e.g services for individual datagrams: | e.g service for a flow of datagrams |
|---|---|
| guaranteed delivery | In-order datagram delivery |
| guaranteed delivery with less than 40 msec delay | guaranteed min-bandwidth to flow |
||restrictions on changes in inter-packet spacing|

| NetworkArchitecture| ServiceModel| GuaranteeBandwith| GuaranteeLoss| GuaranteeOder| GuaranteeTimeing| Congestion Feedback|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Internet| BestEffort| none| no| no| no| no(inferred via loss)| 

## Router

### Router architecture overview

- see **slide 11** for a high-level view of generic router architecture


### Input port functions

decentralized switching: 
using header field values, lookup output port using forwarding table in input port memory (“match plus action”)
goal: complete input port processing at ‘line speed’
queuing: if datagrams arrive faster than forwarding rate into switch fabric
Input port functions
decentralized switching: 
using header field values, lookup output port using forwarding table in input port memory (“match plus action”)
destination-based forwarding: forward based only on destination IP address (traditional)
generalized forwarding (e.g. SDN): forward based on any set of header field values
Switching fabrics
transfer packet from input buffer to appropriate output buffer
switching rate: rate at which packets can be transfer from inputs to outputs
often measured as multiple of input/output line rate
N inputs: switching rate N times line rate desirable
three types of switching fabrics
Switching via memory
first generation routers:
traditional computers with switching under direct control of CPU
packet copied to system’s memory
 speed limited by memory bandwidth (2 bus crossings per datagram)
Switching via a bus
datagram from input port memory
    to output port memory via a shared bus
bus contention:  switching speed limited by bus bandwidth
32 Gbps bus, Cisco 5600: sufficient speed for access and enterprise routers
Switching via interconnection network
overcome  bus bandwidth limitations
banyan networks, crossbar, other interconnection nets initially developed to connect processors in multiprocessor
advanced design: fragmenting datagram into fixed length cells, switch cells through the fabric. 
Cisco 12000: switches 60 Gbps through the interconnection network
Input port queuing
fabric slower than input ports combined -> queueing may occur at input queues 
queueing delay and loss due to input buffer overflow!
Head-of-the-Line (HOL) blocking: queued datagram at front of queue prevents others in queue from moving forward
Output ports
buffering required when datagrams arrive from fabric faster than the transmission rate
scheduling discipline chooses among queued datagrams for transmission
Output port queueing
buffering when arrival rate via switch exceeds output line speed
queueing (delay) and loss due to output port buffer overflow!
How much buffering?
RFC 3439 rule of thumb: average buffering equal to “typical” RTT (say 250 msec) times link capacity C
e.g., C = 10 Gpbs link: 2.5 Gbit buffer
recent recommendation: with N flows, buffering equal to 
Scheduling mechanisms
scheduling: choose next packet to send on link
FIFO (first in first out) scheduling: send in order of arrival to queue
real-world example?
discard policy: if packet arrives to full queue: who to discard?
tail drop: drop arriving packet
priority: drop/remove on priority basis
random: drop/remove randomly
Scheduling policies: priority
priority scheduling: send highest priority queued packet 
multiple classes, with different priorities
class may depend on marking or other header info, e.g. IP source/dest, port numbers, etc.
real world example? 
Scheduling policies: still more
Round Robin (RR) scheduling:
multiple classes
cyclically scan class queues, sending one complete packet from each class (if available)
real world example?
Scheduling policies: still more
Weighted Fair Queuing (WFQ): 
generalized Round Robin
each class gets weighted amount of service in each cycle
real-world example?

4.3 IP: Internet Protocol
datagram format
fragmentation

IPv6
The Internet network layer
host, router network layer functions:
IP datagram format
IP fragmentation, reassembly
network links have MTU (max.transfer size) - largest possible link-level frame
different link types, different MTUs 
large IP datagram divided (“fragmented”) within net
one datagram becomes several datagrams
“reassembled” only at final destination
IP header bits used to identify, order related fragments
IP fragmentation, reassembly

4.3 IP: Internet Protocol
datagram format
fragmentation
IPv4 addressing
network address translation
IPv6
host IP address
IP address: 32-bit, 4-byte identifier for host, router interface 
interface: connection between host/router and physical link
host typically has one or two interfaces (e.g., wired Ethernet, wireless 802.11)
router’s typically have multiple interfaces
One IP address for each interface
IP address: decimal  binary
Subnets
Q: how are interfaces actually connected?
Subnets in networks
IP address: 
subnet part - high order bits
host part - low order bits 
what’s a subnet ?
device interfaces with same subnet part of IP address
can physically reach each other without intervening router
Subnets
subnet . host#
223.1.1.3
street . house#
Smith St . 3

Write IP address
IP address: 	223.1.1.3
subnet mask: 	255.255.255.0

shorthand:	223.1.1.3/24
Subnets


Subnets
how many subnets?
6
subnet address?
223.1.1.0/24
…
223.1.9.0/24
host IP address?
router IP address?
IP Address – Classful
IP addressing: CIDR
CIDR: Classless InterDomain Routing
subnet portion of address of arbitrary length
address format: a.b.c.d/x, where x is # bits in subnet portion of address
IP addresses: how to get one?
Q: how does network get subnet part of IP addr?
A: gets allocated portion of its provider ISP’s address space

Q: how does an ISP get block of addresses?
A: ICANN: Internet Corporation for Assigned 
     Names and Numbers http://www.icann.org/
allocates addresses
manages DNS
assigns domain names, resolves disputes

IP addresses: how to get one?
Q: How does a host get IP address?

hard-coded by system admin in a file
Windows: control-panel->network->configuration->tcp/ip->properties
UNIX: /etc/rc.config
DHCP: Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol: dynamically get address from as server
“plug-and-play” 


DHCP: Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
goal: allow host to dynamically obtain its IP address from network server when it joins network
can renew its lease on address in use
allows reuse of addresses (only hold address while connected/“on”)
support for mobile users who want to join network (more shortly)
DHCP overview:
host broadcasts “DHCP discover” msg [optional]
DHCP server responds with “DHCP offer” msg [optional]
host requests IP address: “DHCP request” msg
DHCP server sends address: “DHCP ack” msg 

DHCP client-server scenario
DHCP client-server scenario
DHCP: more than IP addresses
DHCP can return more than just allocated IP address on subnet:
address of first-hop router for client
name and IP address of DNS sever
network mask (indicating network versus host portion of address)
DHCP: example
connecting laptop needs its IP address, addr of first-hop router, addr of DNS server: use DHCP
DHCP: example
DCP server formulates DHCP ACK containing client’s IP address, IP address of first-hop router for client, name & IP address of DNS server

NAT: network address translation
motivation: Run out of public IP addresses! local network uses just one IP address as far as outside world is concerned:
Use one public IP address to the outside
assigned by ISP
Use private IP addresses internally – free!
10.0.0.0/8
172.16-31.0.0/16
192.168.0-255.0/24

Private IP Address
NAT: network address translation
NAT: network address translation
   implementation: NAT router must:

outgoing datagrams: replace (source IP address, port #) of every outgoing datagram to (NAT IP address, new port #)
. . . remote clients/servers will respond using (NAT IP address, new port #) as destination addr

remember (in NAT translation table) every (source IP address, port #)  to (NAT IP address, new port #) translation pair

incoming datagrams: replace (NAT IP address, new port #) in dest fields of every incoming datagram with corresponding (source IP address, port #) stored in NAT table

NAT: network address translation
NAT: network address translation
16-bit port-number field: 
60,000 simultaneous connections with a single LAN-side address!
NAT is controversial:
routers should only process up to layer 3
address shortage should be solved by IPv6
violates end-to-end argument
NAT possibility must be taken into account by app designers, e.g., P2P applications
NAT traversal: what if client wants to connect to server behind NAT?

IPv6
IPv6: motivation
initial motivation: 32-bit address space soon to be completely allocated.  
additional motivation:
header format helps speed processing/forwarding
header changes to facilitate QoS 

IPv6 datagram format: 
fixed-length 40 byte header
IPv6 address: 128 bits, 16 bytes
no fragmentation allowed
IPv6 datagram format
Other changes from IPv4
checksum: removed entirely to reduce processing time at each hop
options: allowed, but outside of header, indicated by “Next Header” field
ICMPv6: new version of ICMP
additional message types, e.g. “Packet Too Big”
multicast group management functions
Transition from IPv4 to IPv6
not all routers can be upgraded simultaneously
no “flag days”
how will network operate with mixed IPv4 and IPv6 routers? 
tunneling: IPv6 datagram carried as payload in IPv4 datagram among IPv4 routers

Question: how do forwarding tables (destination-based forwarding) or flow tables (generalized forwarding) computed?
Answer: by the control plane (next chapter)
