#  Ch3 Transport Layer

## Transport Layer Services

- provices logical communication between apps and process on different hosts
- runs on end systems
  - sender breaks message down into segments and are reassembered by reciever
- Services includes:
  - TCP - Reliable, in-order delivery
  - UDP - unreliable, unordered delivery
- Transport v Networklayer
  - transport: logical communication btween hosts
  - network: locigal communication btwween processes(applications)

## Multiplexing & DeMultiplexing

- **Multiplexing**: Handles data from multiple socket and add transport headers
- **DeMultiplexing** use Header to deliver segment to correct socket

### Demultiplexing

- Host recieves datagram and uses it to direct segment to socket, datagram contains:
  - host,dest IP
  - source/dest port number
  - transport layer segment
- UDP Segment
  - check dest port > send
- TCP Segment
  - check source ip,port & dest ip/port > send

## UDP - User Datagram Protocol

- basics
  - Barebone Internet transport protocol, Segment maybe lost & out-of-order
  - connectionless: no handshake, each segments are handled independantly
- UDP Checksum: check errors
  1. add two 16-bit int together (overflow added at the end)
  2. compare(add) with checksum, if all 16-bit is one > success

## Principles of rdt (reliable data transport)

- vital for application, transport, link layer
- rdt1.0: sending over reliable channel is ok
- rdt2.0: sender send one packet, wait for AK, then next packet
- rdt2.1: add sequence number in datagrams incase theres an error midway
  - if packet is not recieved, resend latest packet using the latest AK sequence number
- rdt3.0: add timeout, removed NACK

## Pipelining GoBackN

- send number of packets based on sending window #
- reciever returns cumulative ACK
- if one sending packet is lost, reciever discard subsequent packets and resend latest successful ACK
- if ACK is lost from reciever, because all packets are successful, reciever will assume that all Packets are successful.
