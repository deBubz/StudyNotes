# Ch4 DataPlane (network layer)

- transport segment from sender(encapsulate into datagrams) to reciever(deliver to transport layer)
- Network Layer Protocol are presented in every hosts, routers
- Routing( determine route taken)
- Formatting( move packet)
- **Control Plane**: network wide logic to determine how router moves along end-end paths
- **Data Plane**: local per router funtion to determine how arriving datagram is forwarded.

## Router

- generic architecture:
  1. routing processor (software)
  2. input ports: use datagram header values, look up output port using forwarding table
  3. switching fabric: transfer buffering packet from input to output(memory,bus,crossbar)
  4. output ports: data can be loss through congestion

## Internet Protocol

- IP datagram format: datagram len 32bits, header 20 bytes
- 1 ip for each interface(connection between host/ router and physical link)
- Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol DCHP
  - dynamically get address from server
  - allow host to obtain its IP from network server when joined
  - host broadcast DHCP discover
  - DHCP respond with DHCP offer
  - host request IP DHCP request
  - DHCP sends DHCP ack

## Network Address Translation

- when there are nomore public IP addr to used
  - use assigned public IP by ISP
  - use private IP
  - 10.0.0.0/8
  - 172.16.0.0/16
  - 192.168.(0-255).0/24
- NAT router will replace source IP from local to NAT IP, update NAT translation table
- on recieved, router use the NAT table to set correct dest IP.
