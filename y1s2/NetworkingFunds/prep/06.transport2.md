# Ch3 Transport Layer (2)

## TCP connection oriented transport

- Overview: 
  - Point-Point: one sender one reciever
  - in-order reliable byte stream
  - handshake(init connection end connection msg)
  - pipelined(TCP set window size)
  - flow controlled
  - full duplex data (bi-directional dataflow containing MSS max segment size)
- TCP header contains (20bit)
  - source/dest port num
  - sequence, ACK num
  - rwnd (recieve window)
  - checksum

### Flow Control

- reciever present free space throught the rwnd(recieve window) value on reciever-sender connection.
- RcvBuffer set size via socket options(default 4097 bytes)
- guarantees reciever buffer will not overflow

### Reliable Data Transfer

- retransmissions are triggered by timeout, duped ACK
- time outs are calculated on the EstimatedRTT
  - SampleRTT = avg time of segment transmisiion untill ACK is recieved
  - a usually = 0.125
  - Estimated RTT = (1-a)Estimated + a(Sample)
  - b usually = 0.25
  - estimated Sample = (1-b)DevRtt + b(|Sample - Estimated|)

### Connection Management

- before sending msg, handshake occurs, establish connection, agree on params
- when done, sender will send a FIN bit to close on sender side, then reciever will send ACK
- then reciever will send FIN bit to close on reciever side, then will send ACK.
- can be done simultaniously

## Congestion Control

- controll too much data too fast.
- **TCP slow start**:
  - slow initial rate, double cwnd every rtt
- switch to CA(linear increments) when cwnd >= ssthresh
- AdativeIncrease: increase cwnd by 1 MSS every RTT till loss detected
- Multiplicative dcr: half cwnd afterloss
- rate = cwnd/RTT

### TCP Throughput

- avg throughput as function of window size, RTT
- avg throughput = 3/4(W/RTT) byte/sec
