# Tutorial Problems

P6. This elementary problem begins to explore propagation delay and transmission delay, two central concepts in data networking. Consider two hosts, A and B, connected by a single link of rate R bps. Suppose that the two hosts are separated by m meters, and suppose the propagation speed along the link is s meters/sec. Host A is to send a packet of size L bits to Host B.

Exploring propagation delay and transmission delay

1. Express the propagation delay, dprop, in terms of m and s.
1. Determine the transmission time of the packet, dtrans, in terms of L and R.
1. Ignoring processing and queuing delays, obtain an expression for the end-to-end delay.
1. Suppose Host A begins to transmit the packet at time t=0 . At time t= dtrans, where is the last bit of the packet?
1. Suppose dprop is greater than dtrans. At time t=d trans  , where is the first bit of the packet?
1. Suppose dprop is less than dtrans. At time t=d trans  , where is the first bit of the packet?
1. Suppose s=2.5⋅10^8  , L=120 bits , and R=56kbps. Find the distance m so that dprop equals dtrans.
