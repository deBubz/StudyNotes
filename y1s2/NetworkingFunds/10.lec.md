- 6.3 multiple access protocols
- 6.4 LANs
- addressing, ARP
  - Ethernet
  - switches
  - VLANS

## 1. Link layer: introduction

- **terminology**:
  - hosts and routers: nodes
  - communication channels connecting adjacent nodes along communication path: links
- Media:
  - wired links: fibre, Ethernet, coaxial, phone line
  - wireless links: WiFi, Cellular
- Topology
  - point-to-point
  - LANs: WiFi, Cell, Ethernet switch

## Link layer: context

- layer-2 packet: **frame**, encapsulates datagram
- datagram transferred by different link protocols over different links:
  - `e.g.` WiFi on first link, coaxial and fibre on intermediate links, Ethernet on last link
- each  link protocol provides different services
  - `e.g.` may or may not provide rdt over link

## Link layer services

- **framing, link access**:
  - encapsulate datagram into frame, adding header, trailer
  - channel access if shared medium
  - “MAC” addresses used in frame headers to identify source, destination  
    - different from IP address
- **reliable delivery between adjacent nodes**
  - we learned how to do this already (chapter 3)!
  - seldom used on low bit-error link (fiber, some twisted pair)
  - wireless links: high error rates
    - Q: why both link-level and end-end reliability?

### Link layer services (more)

- **flow control**:
  - pacing between adjacent sending and receiving nodes
- **error detection**:
  - errors caused by signal attenuation, noise.
  - receiver detects presence of errors:
    - signals sender for retransmission or drops frame
- **error correction**:
  - receiver identifies and corrects bit error(s) without resorting to retransmission
- **half-duplex and full-duplex**
  - with half duplex, nodes at both ends of link can transmit, but not at same time

## Where is the link layer implemented?

- in each and every host
- link layer implemented in “adaptor” (aka **network interface** card NIC) or on a chip
  - Ethernet card, 802.11 card; Ethernet chipset
  - implements link, physical layer
- attaches into host’s system buses
- combination of hardware, software, firmware

### Adaptors communicating

- sending side:
  - encapsulates datagram in frame
  - adds error checking bits, rdt, flow control, etc.
- Recieving side:
  - check for error, rdt, flow controll, etc.
  - extracts datagram, passes to upper layer at recieving side.

See s8 datagram diagram

## 2. Error detection

s10 (redundant info?)

## Internet checksum (review)

- Used to detect "error" (flipped bits) in transmitted packet (only used at transport layer)

- **sender**:
  - treat segment contents as sequence of 16-bit integers
  - checksum: addition (1’s complement sum) of segment contents
  - sender puts checksum value into UDP checksum field
- **reciever**
  - compute checksum of recieved segment
  - check if computed checksum equals checksum field value
    - `NO` - error detected
    - `YES` - no error detected (does not mean there is no error)

## Parity checking

- used to check bits for error
- **Single bit parity**:
  - detect single bit errors
  - one bit even parity
- two-dimensional bit parity
  - detect and correct single bit errors

## Cyclic redundancy check (optional)

slide 13

- more powerful error-detection coding
- view data bits, D, as a binary number
- choose r+1 bit pattern (generator), G
- goal: choose r CRC bits, R, such that
  - <D,R> exactly divisible by G (modulo 2)
  - receiver knows G, divides <D,R> by G.  If non-zero remainder: error detected!
  - can detect all burst errors less than r+1 bits
- widely used in practice (Ethernet, 802.11 WiFi, ATM)

## CRC example

- want:
- D.2r XOR R = nG
- equivalently:
- D.2r = nG XOR R
- equivalently:  
  - if we divide D.2r by G, want remainder R to satisfy:

## 3. Multiple access links, protocols

**two types** of “links”

- point-to-point
  - PPP for dial-up access
  - point-to-point link between Ethernet switch, host
- **broadcast** (shared wire or medium)
  - old-fashioned Ethernet
  - upstream HFC
  - 802.11 wireless LAN

## Multiple access protocols

- single shared broadcast channel 
- two or more simultaneous transmissions by nodes: interference
  - **collision** if node receives two or more signals at the same time
- **multiple access protocol**
  - distributed algorithm that determines how nodes share channel, i.e., determine when node can transmit
  - communication about channel sharing must use channel itself!
    - no out-of-band channel for coordination

## MAC protocols: taxonomy

three broad classes:

- **channel partitioning**
  - divide channel into smaller “pieces” (time slots, frequency, code)
  - allocate piece to node for exclusive use
- **random access**
  - channel not divided, allow collisions
  - “recover” from collisions
- “**taking turns”**
  - nodes take turns, but nodes with more to send can take longer turns

## Channel partitioning MAC protocols: **TDMA**

TDMA: **Time Division Multiple Access**

- access to channel in "rounds"
- each station gets fixed length slot (length = packet transmission time) in each round
- unused slots go idle
- example: 6-station LAN, 1,3,4 have packets to send, slots 2,5,6 idle

## Channel partitioning MAC protocols: **FDMA**

FDMA: **Frequency Division Multiple Access**

- channel spectrum divided into frequency bands
- each station assigned fixed frequency band
- unused transmission time in frequency bands go idle 
- example: 6-station LAN, 1,3,4 have packet to send, frequency bands 2,5,6 idle

## An ideal multiple access protocol

TDMA or FDMA satisfactory? `No`

- Only use a fraction of the link, even no other traffic
- Heavy coordination processing/traffic

**Ideal**: given broadcast channel of a desired rate R bps:

1. when one node wants to transmit, it can send at rate R.
2. when M nodes want to transmit, each can send at *average* rate R/M
3. fully decentralized: no special node to coordinate transmissions
4. simple

## Pure (unslotted) ALOHA

- **unslotted Aloha**: simple, no coordination
- when frame first arrives
  - transmit immediately
- collision problem:
  - frame sent at t0 collides with other frames sent in [t0-1,t0+1]

s22 diagram

## Pure ALOHA efficiency (Optional)

```md
P(success by given node) = P(node transmits) .
P(no other node transmits in [t0-1,t0]
P(no other node transmits in [t0-1,t0]
define p as the probability that a device transmits in one slot
    = p . (1-p)N-1 . (1-p)N-1  
    = p . (1-p)2(N-1)
… choosing optimum p and then letting n
    = 1/(2e) = .18
```

## Slotted ALOHA

- **assumptions**:
  - all frames same size
  - time divided into equal size slots (time to transmit 1 frame)
  - nodes start to transmit only slot beginning 
  - nodes are synchronized
  - if 2 or more nodes transmit in slot, all nodes detect collision
- **operation**:
  - when node obtains fresh frame, transmits in next slot
    - *if no collision*: node can send new frame in the next slot
    - *if collision*: node restransmits frame in each subsequemt slot with propb. `p` untill success

s24 - 25 diag

### Pros and cons of slotted ALOHA

- **Pros**:
  - single active node can continuously transmit at full rate of channel
  - highly decentralized: only slots in nodes need to be in sync
  - simple
- **Cons**:
  - collisions, wasting slots
  - idle slots
  - nodes may be able to detect collision in less than time to transmit packet
  - clock synchronization

### Efficiency of Slotted ALOHA

> **Efficiency** in the long-run fraction of successful slots (many nodes, all with many frames to send)

- suppose N nodes with many frames to send, each transmits in slot with probability p
- prob that given node has success in a slot `= p(1-p)N-1`
- prob that any node has a success `= Np(1-p)N-1`
- max efficiency find `p*` that maximizes `Np(1-p)^N-1`

`max efficiency = 1/e = .37`

> **At best** channel used for useful transmissions 37% of time

### Can we avoid collision?

- **CSMA (carrier sense multiple access)** listen before talk:
  - if channel sensed idle: transmit entire frame
  - if channel sensed busy, defer transmission
  - human analogy: don’t interrupt others!
    - the polite conversationalist

### CSMA collisions

**CSMA** - Carrier Sense Multiple Access

- collisions **can still occur**: propagation delay means  two nodes may not hear each other’s transmission
- **collision**: entire packet transmission time wasted
  - distance & propagation delay play role in in determining collision probability

### CSMA/CD (collision detection)

- **CSMA/CD**: carrier sensing, deferral as in CSMA
  - collisions detected within short time
  - colliding transmissions aborted, reducing channel wastage
- **collision detection**:
  - easy in wired LANs: measured signal strengths, compare transmitted, recieve signals
  - difficult in wireleass LANs: recieved singal strength overwhelmed by local transmission strength in WiFi, its CSMA/CA (**Collision Avoidance**)

## Ethernet CSMA/CD algorithm

1. NIC receives datagram from network layer, creates frame
2. If NIC senses channel idle, starts frame transmission.
If successful, NIC is done with frame!
3. If NIC senses channel busy,
   - defer until channel idle, then transmit
4. If detects another transmission while transmitting - collision
   - Collision: abort transmission, go to **Backoff Mode**
5. After collision -> binary (exponential) backoff:
   - after mth collision
   - chooses K at random from {0,1,2, …, 2m-1}.
   - waits for K slots, slot=512*bit time

> 1. after 1st collision: m=1, k is chosen in {0,1} -> `k=1, 1`
> 2. after 2nd collision: m=2, k is chosen in {0,1,2,3} -> `k=2, 2`
> 3. after 3rd collision: m=3, k is chosen in {0,1,2,…,7}  ->`k=4, 6`

s31 diagram

## CSMA/CD efficiency

- `T-prop` = max prop delay between 2 nodes in LAN
- `t-trans` = time to transmit max-size frame

> Efficiency = 1/(1+5t prop/t-trans)

- efficiency depends on
  - as t-prop increases, efficiency goes down (`tprop=0 -> eff=100%`)
  - as t-trans increases, efficiency goes up
- better performance than ALOHA: and simple, cheap, decentralized!
- CSMA/CD was standardized in Ethernet

### “Taking turns” MAC protocols

- **channel partitioning MAC protocols**:
  - share channel efficiently and fairly at high load
  - inefficient at low load: delay in channel access, 1/N bandwidth allocated even if only 1 active node! 
- **random access MAC protocols**:
  - **efficient at low load**: single node can fully utilize channel
  - **high load**: collision overhead
- “taking turns” protocols look for best of both worlds!

- **polling**: s33
  - master node “invites” slave nodes to transmit in turn
  - typically used with “dumb” slave devices
    - Bluetooth
  - concerns:
    - polling overhead
    - latency
    - single point of failure (master)
- **token passing** s34
  - control `token` passed from one node to the next sequentially
  - token message
  - concerns
    - token overhead
    - latency
    - single point of failure(token)

## Cable Access Network (Optional)
