## Creating a network app

- Write programs that
  - runs on different systems & communicates over network
  - `e.g` webserver <-> broswe
- No need to write software for network core devices
  - network core devices do not run in the app
  - there are libraries that can handle this
  - achieve decoupling, better for when the networkcore have updates
  - allow rapid app development & propagation

## Appliaction Architectures

- Possible structure of application
  - Client-server (standard)
  - Peer-2-Peer (bad)
  
## Client-Server Architecture

- Server(host)
  - Always on, continuous operation.
  - has a permanent IP address
  - usually runs on a data center for scaling purposes
- Clients:
  - Does not communicate directly with other clients (communicate through server)
  - **dynamic** IP address
  - maybe intermittently connected (briefly, periodically)

## Peer-2-peer Architecture

- **Not** always on
- Arbitrary(random? unknown) end systems directly connects/communicates
- End-users(peer) directly request service from other peers, and/or provide services in return to other peers
  - Self Scalability - new peers brings new service capacity, as well as new demands.
- Peers are intermittently connected & change their IPs
  - Quite complex management

## Process Communicating

- **Process**: program running within a host
  - process`es` in **different** hosts communicates by exchanging messages
  - process`es` in **same** host communicates using **Inter-Process communication** (defined by the OS).
- **Client Process**: process that initiate communication (GET)
- **Server Process**: process that waits for connection (RETURN)
- **Aside**: apps with P2P have both Client&Server processes

## Sockets

- Think of a physical mailbox
- Where Processes `plugs` into a network
- Process **Send/Recieves** messages to/from its **Sockets**
  - Sending process push messages out
  - Sending process relies on the transport infastructure on the next layer to deliver to sockets at the recieving process

## Addressing Process

- To be able to retrieve messages, process must contain an **identifier**
- Host devices have a unique 32-bit ip address
- **QUESTION**: Is Host IP sufficient as an Identifier for processes?
  - `NO`, 1 host could be running multiple processes
- **Identifiers** are often BOTH `IP` address & `Port` number associated with the process on host
  - Http: port 80
  - Mail: 25
  - SSh: 22

## Application-Layer protocol

- `e.g` : Http, Smtp, Skype, Youtube, Facebook
- **Application-layer** protocols defines:
  - The type of msg exchanged: request, response
  - msg syntax: What fields, how fields are delineated (represented)
  - message schematic: meaning of information in fields
  - rules: when & how processes send/recieve messages
- Open protocols:
  - Defined at RFC & IETF, alows interoperability
- Proprietary protocols: Skype, Fb, WeChat

## What transport services do apps need?

- Data Intergrity:
  - Reliable, secure data transfer
  - some apps can tollerate some loss
- Timing
  - some apps require low delay to be effective
- Throughput
  - some apps require high throughput to be effective, some doesnt

### Transport Service Reqquirements

| App | data loss | throughput | time sensitivity |
|---|---|---|---|
| File transfer | no loss | elastic | no |
| email | no loss | elastic | no |
| WebDoc | no loss | elastic | no |
| Real-time Vid/Audio | loss-tolerant | a: 1kb-5mbps v:1kb-10mbps | yes ~100ms |
| Stored Audio/Vid | loss-tolerant | same as above | same as above |
| Interactive Game | loss-tolerant | few kbps upload | yes
| Text Messaging| no loss | elastic | yes & no |

## Internet Transport Protocol Service

- **TPC**
  - Reliable Transport: btween sendong & recieving process
  - Flow control: sender wont overwhem reciever (DDOS?)
  - Congestion control: throtle sender when network overloaded
  - Doesnot provide: timing, throughput guarantee, security
  - Connection0oriented: setup required btween client & server processes
- **UDP**
  - Unreliable data transfer: btween sendong & recieving process
  - Doesnt provide: reliability, flowcontrol, congestion control, timing, throughput guarantee, security or connection setup
- Why UDP tho

### Internet apps: which transport protocols to use

| Application | Application layer protocol | underlying transport protocol |
|---|---|---|
| Email | SMTP [RFC 2821] | TCP |
| remote terminal access| Telnet [RFC 854] | TCP |
| Web | Http [RFC 2616] | TCP |
| file transfer | FTP [RFC 959] | TCP |
| Streaming multimedia | HTTP, RTP [RFC 1889] | TCP or UDP |
| Internet telephony | SIPm RTP, proprietary | TCP or UDP |

## Securing TCP (OPTIONAL ch8)

- TCP & UDP
  - no encryption
  - `cleartext password snet into socket traverse Internet in cleartext ??`
- SSL:
  - provide encrypted TCP connection, data integrity & end-point auth
  - SSL is at app layer
    - apps uses SSL libraries to talk to TCP
  - SSL socket API: cleartext pw sent into socket traverse Internet encrypted

## 2. Web & HTTP

### HTTP overview

- Http: Hypertext Transfer Protocol
  - WEb application layer protocol
  - client/server model
    - Client request data, recieves the response
    - Server send obj response to request
  - Uses TPC:
    1. Client initiate TCP connection (create socket) to server @ port 80
    2. Server accept connection
    3. Http messages exchanges btween browser(http client) & web server(http host)
    4. TCP closed
  - HTTP is stateless as server maintain no info about past request( isit all done on the clinet side?)
  - **Aside**: protocols that maintain states are complex.
  - Http Connections
    - Persistent: multiple obj can be sent over a single TCP connection
    - non-persistent: 
      - at most one obj sent over TCP connection, then its closed
      - dling multiple objs require multiple connetions

#### Persistent Http

1. client initiate tpc connection at URL port 80
2. Server at host URL waiting for TCP connection @ port 80, accepts/notify client
3. Client send request msg into TCP socket
4. Server recieves request, creates respond messages and send message to the Client's socket
5. Client recieves response msg, display web data
6. server close TCP connection
7. Client acknowledge reception of all objs, Closes TCP

Details

- Serer leaves connection after sending response
- Subsequent Http mesages btween same client server/client over open connection

#### Non-Persistent Http

1. Client Initiate HTTP connection at port 80
2. Server at host URL waiting for TCP connection @ port 80, accepts/notify client
3. Client send request msg into TCP socket
4. Server recieves request, creates respond messages and send message to the Client's socket
5. HTTP server closes connection
6. HTTP client display data containing code referencing jpeg objs
7. repeat step 1-6 for each obj

Details

- RTT: time for a small packet to travel from client-server & back
- HTTp response time: 
  - 2x for http file
- Browser often open parallel TCp connections tofetch referenced objs

### HTTP request messages

- Request, response

#### Uploading form input

- POST:
  - form input on webpage, uploaded to server in entity body
- URL method
  - GET method, input is uploaded URL
- Method types
  - HTTP/1.0
    - GET
    - POST
    - HEAD: ask server to leave requested obj out of response
  - HTTP/1.1
    - GET,POST,DEAD
    - PUT: upload file in entity body to path specified in url field
    - DELETE: lul
- HTTP response status code
  - 200 OK
  - 301 Moved Permanently
  - 400 Bad Request
  - 404 Not found
  - 505 HTTP Version Not supported
  
### Cookies

- sites use cookies to keep state
- When initial Http request arrives at server, it creates:
  - unique ID
  - entry in backed db for ID
  - all actions recorded associate with ID
  - on return, user is identified by the cookie and actions are recalled
- Cookies Usage
  - Authorization
  - Shopping cart
  - Recomendations
  - User session state
- How to keep state
  - protocol endpoints maintain state at sender/reciever over multiple transactions
  - cookies
- nasty for privacy

### Web Caching

- Used to satisfy client request without involving server
- User sets browser: web accesses via cache
- Broser sends all http requests to cache
  - Cache returns obj from proxy server
  - If not present, cache request from origin server then return to clinet
- Cache acts as both client and server
- typically installed by ISP (uni, company, residential ISP)
- Why web cache?
  - reduce response time for client request
  - reduce traffic on access links
