### P3 Case Study

> Consider an application that transmits data at a steady rate (for example, the sender generates an N-bit unit of data every k time units, where k is small and fixed). Also, when such an application starts, it will continue running for a relatively long period of time.

**Packet Switch** all packets in each data transfer must be completely loaded before forwarded to the next link

**Circuit Switch** means there are reserved resources alocated specificly for a user.

1. `circuit-switching` data is transfered **constantly** overtime. Therefore alocating specific resource for the app will prevent packet loss.
2. congestion(slow down rate of when packets are send) protocol is reccomended if using `packet-switching` to prevent packet-loss while queuing **multiple** tasks at a network link.

### p10 something maths

Packet length L begins at EndA travels 3 link

Ri == transmission rate for i = 1,2,3

```md
SystA --> link1 ---> link2 ---> link3 ---> Destination

L size
Ri rate

delay = L/Ri
R1 = 1mbps
R2, R3 = 2mbps

```

```math #math
    (1500x8)/1000000 = 12ms link1
    link2, link3 = 6 ms
    total 24ms
```

L/1mbps + 2(L/2mbps)

**Propagation delay** delay between 2 host

**Processing Delay** process where to forward the packet

**Queuing Delay** Manage queuing where there are multiple different packets

**Host** nbn box is a host
