# Intro to PostGresSQL

## General Info

- Architecture fundamentals:
  - `Postgres` uses a client/server model. A `Postgres` session consist of these cooperating processes
    - a `postgres` server program responsible for managing the db files, accepting connections to the db, perfrm db actions
    - User clients apps (frontend) that wants to perfrom db actions. It could be a text based tool, GUi, WebServer
  - PostGres can handle multiple concurrent connection from clients, by forking a new process for each connection. From then Server-Client communicates without intervention from the original `postgres` process.

## Creating Db

- Gotta learn how to configure PATH

```postgres
createdb [dbname]
```
