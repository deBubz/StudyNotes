# Class Activity 9 – SQL III

## Tutorial 9 Activities

The following SQL exercises are based on 4 tables extracted from the Hospital database:

Drug(DrugNo,DrugName,DrugDesc,DrugDosg,DrugMethod,DrugPrice)

Patient(PatID,PatFName,PatLName,PatGender,PatDOB,PatStreet,
PatCity,PatState,PatPostcode,PatPhone,PatRDate)

PatMChart(PatCID,PatID*,PatAdmDate,PatDisDate,PatSymp,PatDiag)
FK (PatID) references Patient

PrescribedDrug(DrugNo*,(PatCID,PatID)*,DrugAmt,StartDate,EndDate)
FK (DrugNo) references Drug
FK (PatCID,PatID) references PatMChart

### Part 1

1. List all admission dates and their symptoms for patient “Jane Adams”.

- Construct a SELECT statement that contains a JOIN

```sql

```

- Construct a SELECT statement that contains a simple Subquery

```sql
select patadmdate, patsymp from patmchart
where patid = (
    select patid from patient
    where patlname = 'Adams');
```

- Describe the differences in execution steps and the result between using a Join and a Simple Subquery to provide the info requested in the question.

2. Give all patients that originate from the same state as “Mitchell Newell”.

- Construct a SELECT statement that contains a JOIN
- Construct a SELECT statement that contains a simple Subquery

```sql
select * from patient
where patstate = (
    select patstate from patient
    where patlname = 'Newell');
```

- Describe the differences in execution steps and the result between using a Join and a Simple Subquery to provide the info requested in the question.

3. Give drugs with prices that fall between the price of Nurofen and Morphine inclusively.

- Construct a SELECT statement that contains a JOIN
- Construct a SELECT statement that contains a simple Subquery
  
```sql
select * from drug
where drugprice between
        (select drugprice from drug where drugname = 'Nurofen')
and     (select drugprice from drug where drugname = 'Morphine');

```

- Describe the differences in execution steps and the result between using a Join and a Simple Subquery to provide the info requested in the question.

### Part 2 Construct a SELECT statement that contains a Simple Subquery

1. Give the name and price of the most expensive drug.

```sql
select drugname, drugprice from drug 
where drugprice = (
    select max(drugprice) from drug);
```

3. List drugs costing less than the average price.

```sql
select * from drug
where drugprice < (
    select avg(drugprice) from drug);
```

4. Give drug names and prices for drugs that are less expensive than all drugs with dosage “As prescribed by doctor” (Hint: use > all predicate).

```sql
-- does this mean less than the total cost?
-- or
-- avg?

--hmmm
select * from drug
where drugprice >=
    all(select drugprice from drug
    where drugdosg = 'As prescribed by doctor');
```

5. List all patient IDs and names who have been prescribed Panadol or Nurofen (Hint: use =any predicate)

```sql
select patlname, patfname from patient where patid =
any(select patid from prescribeddrug where drugno =
any(select drugno from drug where drugname = 'Panadol' or drugname = 'Nurofen'));
```

6. Give the patient name which has been prescribed the highest amount of Panadol (D1486032).

```sql
select distinct patfname, patlname from patient, prescribeddrug
where   prescribeddrug.patid = patient.patid and 
        prescribeddrug.drugno = (
            select drugno from drug where drugname = 'Panadol') and
        prescribeddrug.drugamt = (
            select max(drugamt) from prescribeddrug where drugno = 'D1486032'); 
```

7. List patient chart admission date and diagnostics for all patients which have been prescribed Vitamin C.

```sql
select patadmdate, patdiag from patmchart, prescribeddrug
where   patmchart.patid = prescribeddrug.patid and
        prescribeddrug.drugno = (
            select drugno from drug where drugname = 'Vitamin C';);
```

8. Find the patient chart ID which uses the largest number of drugs.

```sql
-- feels like a hack
select patcid, sum(drugamt) from prescribeddrug
group by patcid order by sum desc limit 1;
```

9. Give the drug name and description used for the most recent patient chart.

```sql
select drugname, drugdesc from patcid
select drugno from prescribeddrug where patcid = ( select patcid from patmchart where patadmdate = (select max(patadmdate) from patmchart));
```
