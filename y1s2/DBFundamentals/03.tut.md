   - Doctors have a pager number & Nurses have various JobPosition (Doc & Nurses subtype entity of STAFF supertype entity)
2. ERD combine with the previous ERD

### Bill

1. Business Rules

- On discharge, patient will be issued a bill with a UID.
- Bill contains charges for drug prescription, misc items & total fee

2. Final ERD

Justification: In this ERD, the Misc charges are seperated from the MedChart and connect directly to the MedicalBill. This decision is made because the medical chart would only by used for medical purposes(diagnosis, medicine prescription) and any extra charges is recorded on the Bill instead.
