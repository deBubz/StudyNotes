# Lec 10 SQL

## Objectives:

- Correlated/Simple Sub Query
- Examples

## Processing multiple tables Using Subqueries

- **Subquery**: placing an `inner` query (SELECT) inside an `outer` querry
- **Objectives**:
  - In a condition of the `WHERE` clause
  - As a **Table** of the `FROM` clause
  - Within the `HAVING` clause
- **Subqueries (nested queries) can be:**
  - Non-corrolated (Simple/Type 1) - executed once for the entire outer query
  - Corrolated - executed once for each row returned by th outer query

## Subquery Example

- List all products whose price is above average price of products with ‘Oak’ finished.

```sql
Select prodDesc, prodStPrice from product tA
where prodStPrice > (
    select avg(prodStPrice) from product tB
    where tB.prodFinish='Oak'
);
```

```sql
select * from product_t 
where productstandardprice > (
    select avg(productstandardprice) from product_t 
    where productfinish ='Oak');

```

## Correlated Subquery Example
List all products whose price is above average price of products with same finished.

```sql
select productdescription, productstandardprice, productfinish from product_t prod
where productstandardprice > (
    select avg(productstandardprice) from product_t prodb
    where prod.productfinish = prodb.productfinish);
    -- hmmmmmmmmmm
```

## Correlated Subquery

- Show all orders that include furniture finished in Oak.
- Correlated Subquery (equi Join)

```sql

```

- Show all orders that include furniture finished in Oak.

- Show all orders that include furniture finished in Oak using Simple subquery.

- Show all orders that include furniture finished in Oak using Correlated Subquery.

```sql
select orderi.d from orderline_t ol 
where exists(select * from product_t tt where tt.productid = ol.productid and tt.productfinish = 'Oak');
```

## Correlated Subquery 2 (sl8)

- Show all orders that include furniture finished in Oak.

- Show all orders that include furniture finished in natural ash.
- sl 10

## Correlated vs. Noncorrelated Subqueries

- Noncorrelated subqueries:
  - Do not depend on data from the outer query
  - Execute once for the entire outer query
- Correlated subqueries:
  - Make use of data from the outer query
  - Execute once for each row of the outer query
  - Can use the EXISTS operator
  
## Subquery in from clause

Calculate the average price of three groups of products with finishing in Oak, Pine and Walnut.
Subquery in from clause
Another Subquery in From Clause
Show all products whose standard price is higher than the average price

 


select productdescription, productstandardprice, AvgPrice from 
(select round(avg(productstandardprice)) as AvgPrice from product_t) Tavg , product_t
where productstandardprice> AvgPrice;

Tips for Developing Queries
Be familiar with the data model (entities and relationships)
Understand the desired results
Know the attributes desired in results
Identify the entities that contain desired attributes
Review ERD
Construct a WHERE equality for each link
Fine tune with GROUP BY and HAVING clauses if needed
Consider the effect on unusual data
Query Efficiency Considerations
Instead of SELECT *, identify the specific attributes in the SELECT clause; this helps reduce network traffic of result set
Limit the number of subqueries; try to make everything done in a single query if possible
If data is to be used many times, make a separate query and store it as a view

Guidelines for Better Query Design
Understand how indexes are used in query processing
Write simple queries
Break complex queries into multiple simple parts
Don’t nest one query inside another query
Don’t combine a query with itself (if possible avoid self-joins)
Retrieve only the data you need

Routines and Triggers
Routines: Program modules that execute on demand
Functions–routines that return values and take input parameters
Procedures–routines that do not return values and can take input or output parameters
Triggers–routines that execute in response to a database event (INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE)



Embedded and Dynamic SQL
Embedded SQL
Including hard-coded SQL statements in a program written in another language such as C or Java
Dynamic SQL
Ability for an application program to generate SQL code on the fly, as the application is running
Reasons to Embed SQL in 3GL
Can create a more flexible, accessible interface for the user
Possible performance improvement
Database security improvement; grant access only to the application instead of users


Examples


Produce a list of all products (product description) and the number of times each product has been ordered.

Example 1 

Show customers ID and name for all the customers who have ordered both product IDs 3 and 4 on the same order.

Example 2 

```sql
select customerid, customername from customer_t 
where customerid in (
    select customerid form order_t where orderid in (
        select orderid from order_t o
        where 3 in (
            select productid from orderline_t ol 
            where ol.orderid=O.orderid)
        and 4 in (
            select productid from orderline_t ol where ol.orderid = o.orderid
        )));
```
