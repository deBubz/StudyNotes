# Tutorial 8 Activities

## InnerJoin Activities

- Construct a SELECT statement that contains an Equi-Join.
- Manually trace through the data using your SELECT statement to verify that it is correct, and that you understand exactly how the statement is executed.

**Note**: Before you start, read the create table statements and double check the name of the FKs in the tables. For example, staid is PK in STAFF table, and it is FK in NURSE table with different name i.e. nurid.

1. List all the ward numbers that have staff members from Victoria state. Eliminate duplicate values.

```sql
select distinct wardno from nurseward
inner join staff on nurseward.nurid = staff.staid
where staff.stastate = 'VIC';
```

2. List all the ward numbers where staff from New South Wales state have worked in. Organize the list alphabetically descending and avoid duplicates in the result.

```sql
select distinct wardno from nurseward 
inner join staff on nurseward.nurid = staff.staid 
where staff.stastate = 'NSW' order by wardno;`
```

3. List all the ward numbers and the ward name that “Christopher Hanton” has worked in.

```sql
select distinct ward.wardno, ward.wardname
from ward, nurseward,staff
where   ward.ward no = nurseward.wardno and
        nurseward.nurid = staff.staid and
        staff.stalname = 'Hanton';`
```

4. List all the wards names where nurses have worked in “Night” shifts.

```sql
select distinct ward.wardno, ward.wardname
from ward natural join nurseward
where nurseward.shift = 'Night';
```

5. List full name of all staff that live in the same state as staff employee S632.

```sql
select * from staff
where stastate = (
    select stastate from staff where staid = 'S632');
```

6. List full name and salary of staff who get paid more than Christopher Hanton (S632).

```sql
select * from staff 
where stacsalary > (
    select stacsalary from staff
    where staid ='S632');
```

7. For Christopher Hanton (S632), give his salary, and list number and name of the wards he has worked in.

```sql
select distinct staid, stacsalary, ward.wardno, ward.wardname 
from staff, nurseward, ward 
where   staff.staid = nurseward.nurid and
        nurseward.wardno = ward.wardno and
        staid = 'S632';
```

8. List full name of the staff whose salary fall between the salary of Mikalya Vida (S837) and Natasha Laboureyas (S673), not inclusive.

```sql
select (stafname, stalname) as fullname,stacsalary 
from staff 
where   stacsalary > (
            select stacsalary from staff where staid = 'S837') and
        stacsalary < (
            select stacsalary from staff where staid = 'S673');
```

## OuterJoin Activities

- Construct a SELECT statement that contains Full outer join, Left Outer Join or Right Outer Join.
- Manually trace through the data using your SELECT statement to verify that it is correct, and that you understand exactly how the statement is executed.

1. List all ward numbers and staff ID of those who have worked in them. (Give two different ways of constructing this query).

```sql
-- way 1 easy
select nurid, wardno
from nurseward;

```

```sql
--- way 2
select staff.staid, nurseward.wardno from staff
--- can use either [left | right | full] outer join
left outer join nurseward on staff.staid = nurseward.nurid;
```

2. Which staff members have not worked in any wards?

```sql
--- way1 left outer join
select staff.staid, nurseward.wardno from staff 
left outer join nurseward on staff.staid = nurseward.nurid 
where nurseward.nurid is null;
```

```sql
--- way2 right outer join (swap FROM tbl arounf)
select staff.staid, nurseward.wardno from nurseward 
right outer join staff on staff.staid = nurseward.nurid 
where nurseward.nurid is null;
```

3. List all the available wards in 2014 (ward2014) and the capacity of those that are still available.

```sql
--- how does this require outer join?
select * from ward2014
where wardcap != 0;
```

4. Which wards used to be active in 2014, and are not provided anymore?
 
```sql
--- same as q3, 2nd method swap From tbl and RIGHT -> LEFT
select ward.wardno as current, ward2014.wardno as past
from ward right outer join ward2014
on ward.wardno = ward2014.wardno
where ward.wardno is null;
```

5. List all the wards that were available in both the ward2014 and the current wards?

```sql
select ward.wardno as current, ward2014.wardno as past
from ward full outer join ward2014
on ward.wardno = ward2014.wardno
where   ward2014.wardno is not null and
        ward.wardno is not null;
```
