## Week 9

# SQL part 3

## Objectives

1. Non-correlated/ simple Subquery
   - Using All Operator
   - Using IN Operator
   - Using Any Operator
2. Join v Subquery
3. Examples to write Subqueries

## Processing multiple Tables using Subqueries(nested)

- **Subquery**: placing an inner query (SELECT statement) inside an outer query
  - Options:
    - In a condition of the WHERE clause
    - As a "table" of the FROM clause
    - Within the HAVING clause
- Subqueries can be:
  - non corrolated (simple of Type1): Executed once for the entire outer query
  - Corrolated: executed one for each row returned by the outer query.

## Simple subquery

1. Price of the most expensive product

```sql
select max (price)
from product;
```

2. Price and description of the most expensive product

```sql
select prodDesc, prodPrice
from prod
where prdPrice = 1650;
-- previous query can be inserted in here
-- it would be better than searching by a flat value.
```

```sql
from prodDesc, prodPrice
from prod
where prodPrice = (
    Select max(prodProce)
    from prod;
);
```

**So** basicly

- Query in a query
- used in WHERE and HAVING conditions
- executed once
- common use to find min, max.

### ALL operator

```sql
-- 2 queries same result
X = max(price);
X >= ALL(price);
```

### Examples

```sql
select prDesc, prPrice
from prod
where   prPrice = max(prPrice);
--or
        prPrice => Aall(prodPrice);

```

### In operator

- Say Yes if Apple in {Orange, apple, tomato}

1. Names of customers that placed orders

```sql
Select cName
from Customer
where cID IN (
    Select distinct cID
    from Order
);
```

### Rules for using **ALL** and **ANY**

- When a subq returns more than 1 val: **ANY** and **ALL** will be used to link the sub and main queries
- When **All** is used: **every** value is returned by the sub must satisfy the comparison operation
- When **Any** is used: **one or more** value is returned by the sub must satisfy the comparison operation

## 2. Join vs SubQuery

Some queries could be either accomplised by a join or subq

what are the name and address of the customer who placed order num 20@

```sql
-- join
select * from customer, order
where   customer.cID = order.cIT and
        orderID = 20;

-- subq
select * from customer
where customer.cID = (
    Select oID from order
    where oID =20;
);
```

## Examples

1. Show name of cust `16` and name of all the cust that are in the same post as `16`

```sql
select cName from customer;

select cName from customer
where cState = (
    select cPost from customer
    where cId = 16;
    );
```

2. List name of all employees who are managing people with `sID = BS12`, least each manager only once even if that manager manages several people with this skill

```SQL

select distinct managerID, eName from employee
where eID in (
    select cID from EmplSkill
    where sID = "BS12";)

--- 31, 32, 33
```

3. Display employee name who does not posess the skill "router"

```sql
select employeeName from Employee
where cID not in (
    select cID from CustomerSkill
    where skillID = (
        select skillID from Skill
        where skillName = 'Router';););
```

4. Display how man raw matterials supplied by `Pebble Hardware`

```sql
select count(MaterialID) from Supplies 
where vID = (
    select vID from vendor 
    where vName = 'Pebble Hardware';);
```

5. Calculate the number of computer desk sold by each sales person. 

```sql
select salesID, sum(quantity)
from Order Natural Join OrderLine
where productID = (
    select prodID from Product 
    where productDescr = 'Computer Desk';)
group by salesID;
```

## ASK

- difference between `in` and `=`
