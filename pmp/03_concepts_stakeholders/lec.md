## communication management

- key skill for PM

  - surprises are bad in projects
  - PMs must identify problems, challenges and issues early
  - communicate this along with alternatives to overcome problem, challenges and issues

> lack of communication will lead to incorrect assumptions

Communication planning
1. how will the information be stored?
2. what info goes to whom, how often and how?
3. who can access the information
4. who will update/keep the current information
5. what method/media of communication is best

performance reporting to stakeholders
- right info to the right people in the right format
- satisfy stakeholder that progress expectations are being met
- help stakeholder make educated decisions regarding the project
