## Ethics

### A. Issues

> Describe the issues maybe associated with using employee home monitoring technology

1. Obvious Invasion of privacy
2. Pressure to perform
   - gamification of performance metrics/ "productivity score"
   - publication of arbitrary performance metrics to force competition
   - employers can set unrealistic, increasingly harder to achieve goals
   - force to work harder, causes stress, mental health degradation in employees
   - could cause loss of overall productivity due to employees taking advantage of software exploits to meet unrealistic goals
3. Normalization of Surveillance
   - Post covid, people are gradually come into to terms with being monitored.
   - Accepting it as a minor inconvenience in exchange to be able to work remotely.
   - find source ( people getting used to the idea of having their data collected and traded )

### B. Stakeholders

> Identify key stakeholder groups (atleast 1 unique) per issue
> - describe the issue from their point of view and provide reasoning regarding the issue
> - reason the closest ethical principles viewpoint

1. Invasion of Privacy
2. Using Surveillance as pressure to perform
   - employee (consequential)
     - although your boss described this as a "fun game for the team" to encourage competition
     - you feel a strong implication of receiving punishment for "underperforming" on the chart
     - gets anxiety seeing your "productivity score" comparing with the team
     - you have 2 options, work harder or cheat the system
3. Normalization of Surveillance
   - Citizen (consequential)
     - typically non IT experts, with neutral attitude towards 
     - people affected by the change, gradually eroding personal privacy
     - have no choice but to accept being monitored in order to financially support their family otherwise risk the chance of unemployment
     - getting comfortable with doing work from home, being monitored is a minor conveniece 
     - Some case, feel better from spending less time in commute. 
   - Regulators (justice)
     - As Laws and standards are often always behind Regulators should be well informed by industry expert to protect the people
     - Should try to differentiate industry experts with lobbyist to make the most just situation

### C. Personal View

> Discuss your own personal view in relation to each issue

1. Something
2. pressure to perform better
3. Normalization of surveillance 

I would like to think that I am "fair"
After some reflection, being (consequential) best suits my ethical principal
