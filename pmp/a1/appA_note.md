# Notes on example 

## Title: Employee monitoring software surges as companies send staff home

### Introduction

- rhetorical questions involving surveillance at home
- listing surveillance options
  - web visit, social media
  - keystroke rate, bathroom timer
- evidence: sales of surveillance software

### Point 1: rise of surveillance

- rise in the need of tools to track staff productivity 
- surveillance software and its features
  - included customer review(bosses) for such software (POV of stakeholder)
  - monitor employee web usage
  - useful to monitor freelance contractor working hours
  - use keystrokes to "train" employee in using prebuilt hotkeys
- international companies showing interest in australia
- show data providing correlation of the surge of Software clients to the Time of covid restrictions
- (stakeholder POV) software provider is positive of the adaptation of wfh

### Point 2: exerting control

- surveillance is a technology of discipline and domination
- knowing you are being monitored is part of the disciplinary power
- designed and marketed to employers, employee's operation is not in consideration
- more intrusive than being watched in the office 

### POint 3: strong need law reform

- concern how the programs are regulated
- data mined from the software is often out of australian jurisdiction
- big gap in the preservation of employee technology
- covid, concern of the line between home and work is blurred

## Title: Being monitored by your boss while working from home - necessary trade-off or stupid surveillance?

- watching web traffic, time on tasks
- use ML to predict what activities === productivity

### not full picture

- global team, she dont have a problem with it
- remote work needs a lot of trust, keep employee on track to be effective
- software doesnt capture off computer work, its just there for a guideline

### no human flaws

- some work places, everyone is tracked and closely monitored
- turning the workplace into a machine, creating power imbalance between staff and company
- technology advanced so quickly the law cannot catch up
- no general right to privacy in australia
- more employers looking to use this to scrutinise employees

### connections, trust & motivation

- youre not hiring the right people if this technology is used
- should focus more on having social and emotional checkin with staff
- better to have people you trust, people who are passionate about working

### right balance

- careful to balance, data from workplace where monitoring is known is more productive
- maybe because it increases worker satisfaction,
  - unmonitored worker may feel unimportant
- over-monitoring could cause reduced performance
