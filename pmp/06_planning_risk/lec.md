## project management planning

- assumptions and estimates maybe wrong
- things seldom go to plan and a project must adapt to its environment
- unexpected events happen

---

## risks

**risk**
- *uncertain* events or condition that if it occurs, has a positive or negative impact on the project objective
- something that may/may not happen.
- potentially jeopardize the success of the project

**risk management**
- organized mean of identifying and measuring risk
- develop, select and manage options for handling those risk

---

## project risk management

**planning**
- identify, analyse, and develop strategies for responding to risks efficiently and effectively
- providing a warning system for impending or potential problems that need to be addressed or resolved
- decreasing probability/impact of undesirable events

### risk management loops

> repeat

1. risk planning
   - not easy
   - risk can affect project in different ways at different phases
   - risk is planning is active and dynamic
   - knowing availability of time, resources, tools, commitment
   - **can come from many different sources and any direction**
2. risk identification
   - can both be internal/external to the project
   - known, known unknowns and unknown unknowns
   - brainstorming, interviewing, checklist, past projects
   - risk has two components:
     - likelihood of occurrence of that event
     - impact of the event
3. risk assessment
   - reminder that overconfidence is a slow and insidious killer
   - use the probability impact matrix
4. risk strategies
   - a risk response strategy maybe:
     - accept or ignore
     - avoid 
     - reduce/mitigate (via response plan)
     - transfer
   - document project risk and strategies in a risk register
   - risk register/matrix
5. risk monitoring & control
   - after creating the risk plan, the triggers must be monitored to track the risk
   - new threats and opportunities may be uncovered
   - risk monitoring and control may be part of the overall project monitoring and control
   - tools -> risk audits, risk review, risk status meetings and reports
   - **this is a continuous exercise**
6. risk response 
   - when a risk trigger occurs the risk owner  must take appropriate action (per the risk response plan)
   - outcome will be favorable or unfavorable
   - outcome should be assessed for further action
   - **resources and support must be available**
7. risk evaluation
   - know what worked and what didn't
   - recognize/ avoid similar issues
   - improve process
   - **learn the best practice for the future**
