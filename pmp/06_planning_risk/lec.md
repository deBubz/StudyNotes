## project management planning

- **assumptions** and **estimates** maybe wrong
- things **seldom go to plan** and a project must **adapt** to its environment
- unexpected events happen

> purpose of project planning is project **execution**

- plan for what is ahead
  - loss of staff
  - mistakes
  - how to get things back on track
  - "what if planning"
  - tightening budget
  - need more time
  - things not being approved
  - asking budget
- all about trying to for tell what might occur

## risks

**risk**
- *uncertain* events or condition that if it occurs, has a positive or negative impact on the project objective
- something that may/may not happen.
- potentially jeopardize the success of the project

**risk management**
- organized mean of identifying and measuring risk
- develop, select and manage options for handling those risk

> all about asking what if, asking what might happen

## project risk management

**planning**
- identify, analyse, and develop strategies for responding to risks efficiently and effectively
- providing a warning system for impending or potential problems that need to be addressed or resolved
- decreasing probability/impact of undesirable events
  -  where the planning come to place
  -  not guaranteed 100% to be able to deal with all risks
  -  how flexible is your project plan

> trying to tell the future

> creating alot of mini risk management plan, if a problem occurs
> - you can better identify and mitigate the plan

> - risk register: what could go wrong
> - trigger events - trigger risk
>  - risk dominoes, 
> - do you have enough resources to deal with the risk

### risk management loops

> repeat

1. **risk planning**
   - risk can affect project in different ways at different phases
   - risk is planning is active and dynamic
   - knowing availability of time, resources, tools, commitment to solve the risk
   - **can come from many different sources and any direction**
   > workshop task - identify risk
2. **risk identification**
   - any possible risk: - missing key personnel
   - what is the **damage**, **effect** of the risk
   - can both be internal/external to the project
   - known, known unknowns and unknown unknowns
     - letter of resignation 
     - planning for missing personels
   > build in buffers time buffer
   - brainstorming, interviewing, checklist, past projects
   - risk has two components:
     - likelihood of occurrence of that event
     - impact of the event
3. **risk assessment**
   - what **damage** a risk can do when it occurs
   - reminder that overconfidence is a slow and insidious killer
   - use the probability impact matrix
4. **risk strategies**
   - risk mitigation strategies
   - a risk response strategy maybe:
     - accept or ignore
     - avoid 
     - reduce/mitigate (via response plan)
     - transfer
   - document project risk and strategies in a risk register
   - using risk **register/matrix**
   > workshop task
5. **risk monitoring & control** `monitoring trigger events`
   - after creating the risk plan, the **triggers** must be monitored to track the risk
   - new threats and opportunities may be uncovered
   - risk monitoring and control may be part of the overall project monitoring and control
   - tools -> risk audits, risk review, risk status meetings and reports
   - **this is a continuous exercise**
6. **risk response**
   - backup plan
   - when a risk trigger occurs the risk owner  must take appropriate action (per the risk response plan)
   - outcome will be favorable or unfavorable
   - outcome should be assessed for further action
   - **resources and support must be available**
7. **risk evaluation**
   - evaluating your response for further improvement
   - know what worked and what didn't
   - recognize/ avoid similar issues
   - improve process
   - **learn the best practice for the future**

> than go back to 1 again to improve your risk plan
